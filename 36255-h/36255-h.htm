<h1>THE CORNER HOUSE GIRLS ODD FIND</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—A FIND IN THE GARRET</h2>
<p>
The fireboard before the great chimney-place in
the spacious dining room of the old Corner House
in Milton had been removed by Uncle Rufus, and
in the dusk of the winter’s afternoon the black pit
of it yawned, ogre-like, upon the festive room.
</p>
<p>
The shadows were black under the big tree, the
tip of which touched the very high ceiling and
which had just been set up in the far corner and
not yet festooned. The girls were all busy bringing
tinsel and glittering balls and cheery red bells
and strings of pink and white popcorn, while yards
and yards of evergreen “rope,” with which to
trim the room itself, were heaped in a corner.
</p>
<p>
It was the day but one before Christmas, and
without the gaslight—or even the usual gas-log
fire on the hearth—the dining room was gloomy
even at mid-afternoon. Whenever Dot Kenway
passed the black opening under the high and ornate
mantel, she shuddered.
</p>
<p>
It was a creepy, delicious shudder that the smallest
Corner House girl experienced, for she said to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
Tess, her confidant and the next oldest of the four
sisters:
</p>
<p>
“Of course, I know it’s the only way Santa
Claus ever comes. But—but I should think he’d
be afraid of—of rats or things. I don’t see why
he can’t come in at the door; it’d be more respecterful.”
</p>
<p>
“I s’pose you mean respectable,” sighed Tess.
“But where would he hitch his reindeer? You
know he has to tie them to the chimney on the
roof.”
</p>
<p>
“Why does he?” demanded the inquisitive Dot.
“There’s a perfectly good hitching post by our
side gate on Willow Street.”
</p>
<p>
“Who ever heard of such a thing!” exclaimed
Tess, with exasperation. “Do you s’pose Santa
Claus would come to the side door and knock like
the old clo’s man? You are the most ridiculous
child, Dot Kenway,” concluded Tess, with her
most grown-up air.
</p>
<p>
“Say,” said the quite unabashed Dot, reflectively,
“do you know what Sammy Pinkney
says?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing very good, I am sure,” rejoined her
sister, tartly, for just at this time Sammy Pinkney,
almost their next-door neighbor, was very
much in Tess Kenway’s bad books. “What can
you expect of a boy who wants to be a pirate?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Dot proclaimed, “Sammy says he
doesn’t believe there is such a person as Santa
Claus.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” gasped Tess, startled by this heresy.
Then, after reflection, she added: “Well, when
you come to think of it, I don’t suppose there <em>is</em>
any Santa for Sammy Pinkney.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tess!” almost groaned the smaller girl.
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t,” repeated Tess, with greater confidence.
“Ruthie says if we don’t ‘really and
truly’ believe in Santa, there isn’t any—for us!
And he only comes to good children, anyway.
How could you expect Sammy Pinkney to have a
Santa Claus?”
</p>
<p>
“He says,” said Dot, eagerly, “that they are
only make believe. Why, there is one in Blachstein
&amp; Mapes’, where Ruth trades; and another
in Millikin’s; and there’s the Salvation Army
Santa Clauses on the streets—”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh!” exclaimed Tess, tossing her head.
“They are only representations of Santa Claus.
They’re men dressed up. Why! little boys have
Santa Claus suits to play in, just as they have Indian
suits and cowboy suits.”
</p>
<p>
“But—but is there really and truly a Santa
Claus?” questioned Dot, in an awed tone. “And
does he keep a book with your name in it? And
if you don’t get too many black marks through
the year do you get presents? And if you do behave
too badly will he leave a whip, or something
nasty, in your stocking? Say, Tess, do you s’pose
’tis <em>so</em>?”
</p>
<p>
That was a stiff one—even for Tess Kenway’s
abounding faith. She was silent for a moment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
</p>
<p>
“Say! <em>do</em> you?” repeated the smallest Corner
House girl.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you, Dot,” Tess said, finally, “I <em>want</em> to
believe it. I just <em>do</em>. It’s like fairies and elfs.
We want to believe in them, don’t we? It’s just
like your Alice-doll being alive.”
</p>
<p>
“Well!” exclaimed Dot, stoutly, “she’s just as
good as alive!”
</p>
<p>
“Of course she is, Dottie,” said Tess, eagerly.
“And so’s Santa Claus. And—and when we
stop believing in him, we won’t have near so much
fun at Christmas!”
</p>
<p>
Just then Agnes came in from the kitchen with
a heaping pan of warm popcorn.
</p>
<p>
“Here, you kiddies,” she cried, “run and get
your needles and thread. We haven’t near enough
popcorn strung. I believe Neale O’Neil ate more
than he strung last night, I never did see such a
hungry boy!”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. MacCall say it’s ’cause he’s growning,”
said Dot, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
“He, he!” chuckled Agnes. “He should be
‘groaning’ after all he gobbled down last night.
And I burned my finger and roasted my face,
popping it.”
</p>
<p>
She set down the dish of flaky white puff-balls
on a stool, so it would be handy for the little
girls. Both brought their sewing boxes and
squatted down on the floor in the light from a long
window. Tess was soon busily threading the popcorn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with you, Dot Kenway?”
she demanded, as the smallest Corner House girl
seemed still to be fussing with her thread and
needle, her face puckered up and a frown on her
small brow. “You’re the slowest thing!”
</p>
<p>
“I—I believe this needle’s asleep, Tess,” wailed
Dot, finally.
</p>
<p>
“Asleep?” gasped the other. “What nonsense!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, ’tis—so now!” ejaculated Dot. “Anyway,
I can’t get its eye open.”
</p>
<p>
A low laugh sounded behind them, and a tall girl
swooped down on the floor and put her arms
around the smallest Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
“Let sister do it for you, honeybee,” said the
newcomer. “Won’t the eye open? Well! we’ll
make it—there!”
</p>
<p>
This was Ruth, the oldest of the four Kenway
sisters. She was dark, not particularly pretty,
but, as Tess often said, awfully good! Ruth had
a smile that illuminated her rather plain face and
won her friends everywhere. Moreover, she had
a beautiful, low, sweet voice—a “mother voice,”
Agnes said.
</p>
<p>
Ruth had been mothering her three younger sisters
for a long time now—ever since their real
mother had died, leaving Agnes and Tess and
Dot, to say nothing of Aunt Sarah Maltby, in the
older girl’s care. And faithfully had Ruth Kenway
performed her duty.
</p>
<p>
Agnes was the pretty sister (although Tess, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
all her gravity, promised to equal the fly-away in
time) for she had beautiful light hair, a rosy complexion,
and large blue eyes, of an expression most
innocent but in the depths of which lurked the
Imps of Mischief.
</p>
<p>
Little Dot was dark, like Ruth; only she was
most lovely—her hair wavy and silky, her little
limbs round, her eyes bright, and her lips as red
as an ox-heart cherry!
</p>
<p>
The little girls went on stringing the popcorn,
and Ruth and Agnes began to trim the tree, commencing
at the very top. Nestling among the
pointed branches of the fir was a winged cupid,
with bow and arrow.
</p>
<p>
“That’s so much better than a bell. Everybody
has bells,” said Agnes, from the step-ladder,
as she viewed the cupid with satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
“It’s an awfully cunning little fat, white baby,”
agreed Dot, from the floor. “But I should be
afraid, if I were his mother, to let him play with
bows-an’-arrows. Maybe he’ll prick himself.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll speak to Venus about that,” chuckled
Agnes. “Don’t believe anybody ever mentioned
it to her.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Venus’?” repeated Dot, gravely. “Why,
that’s the name of the lady that lives next to Uncle
Rufus’ Petunia. She couldn’t be that little baby’s
mother for she’s—oh!—<em>awful</em> black!”
</p>
<p>
“Aggie was speaking of another Venus, Dot,”
laughed Ruth. “Fasten those little candle-holders
securely, Aggie.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” agreed the second, and slangy, sister.
</p>
<p>
“I really wish we could light the whole room
with candles, and not have the gas at all,” Ruth
said. “It would be much nicer. Don’t you think
so?”
</p>
<p>
“It would be scrumptious!” Aggie cried. “And
you’ve got such a lot of those nice, fat, bayberry
candles. Let’s do it!”
</p>
<p>
“But there are not enough candlesticks.”
</p>
<p>
“You can get ’em at the five-and-ten-cent store,”
proposed Tess, who favored that busy emporium,
“because you can get such a lot for your money!”
</p>
<p>
“Goosey!” exclaimed Agnes. “We don’t want
<em>cheap</em> ones. How would they look beside those
lovely old silver ones of Uncle Peter Stower’s?”
and she turned to look at the great candelabra on
the highboy.
</p>
<p>
Just then the door from the butler’s pantry
opened slowly and a grizzled, kinky head, with a
shiny, brown, bald spot on top, was thrust into
the room.
</p>
<p>
“I say, missie!” drawled the voice belonging
to the ancient head, “is yo’ done seen anyt’ing ob
dat denim bag I has fo’ de soiled napkins?
Pechunia, she done comin’ fo’ de wash, an’ I got t’
collect togeddah all I kin fin’ dis week. Dat fool
brack woman,” Uncle Rufus added with disgust,
“won’t do but dis one wash twill happen New
Years—naw’m! She jes’ got t’ cel’brate, she say.
Ma’ soul! what’s a po’, miserble nigger woman
got t’ cel’brate fo’ Ah asks ye?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, Uncle Rufus!” cried Agnes. “Christmas
is a birthday that <em>everybody</em> ought to celebrate.
And I’m sure Petunia has many things to
make her happy.”
</p>
<p>
“Just look at all her children!” put in Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Alfredia, and Jackson Montgomery Simms,
and little Burne-Jones Whistler and Louise Annette,”
Dot began to intone, naming the roll of
Petunia Blossom’s piccaninnies.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t! Stop!” begged Agnes, with her hands
over her ears and sitting down on the top step
of the ladder.
</p>
<p>
“Ma soul!” chuckled Uncle Rufus, “if chillens
come lak’ Chris’mus presents, all de rich w’ite
folks would hab ’em an’ de po’ nigger folks would
be habbin’ wot de paper calls ‘race sooincide’—sho’
would!”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t seen the laundry bag, Unc’ Rufus,”
said Ruth, deep in thought.
</p>
<p>
Here Dot spoke up. “I ‘spect I know where it
is, Unc’ Rufus,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Wal! I ‘spected some ob yo’ chillen done had
it.”
</p>
<p>
“You know,” said Dot, seriously, “my Alice-doll
is real weakly. The doctors don’t give me
much ’couragement about her. Her lungs are
weak—they have been, you know, ever since that
awful Trouble girl buried her with the dried
apples.”
</p>
<p>
“Dat Lillie Treble. Ah ‘members hit—sho!”
chuckled Uncle Rufus, the Corner House girls’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
chief factotum, who was a tall, thin, brown old
negro, round shouldered with age, but “spry and
pert,” as he said himself.
</p>
<p>
“And the doctors,” went on Dot, waxing serious,
and her imagination “working over time,” as
Neale O’Neil would have said, “say it’s best for
folks with weak lungs to sleep out of doors. So
Neale’s built her a sleeping porch outside one
of the windows in our bedroom—Tess’ and mine—and—and
I used your napkin bag, Unc’ Rufus, for
a sleeping-bag for my Alice-doll! I couldn’t find
anything else that fitted her,” confessed the smallest
Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
“Well! of all the children!” cried Agnes, having
taken her hands down from her ears to hear this.
</p>
<p>
“You shouldn’t have taken the bag without permission,”
Ruth gravely told Dot.
</p>
<p>
But Uncle Rufus chuckled over it to a great
extent. “Nebber did see de beat of dese young-uns!”
he gasped finally. “If yo’ Uncle Peter was
alive he sartain sho’ would ha’ laffed hisself up
out’n hes sick-bed. Ma soul an’ body! W’y
didn’t he know enough t’ hab yo’uns yere in de
ol’ Corner House w’ile he was alive, ‘stid o’ waitin’
till he was daid t’ gib it t’ yo’?”
</p>
<p>
He would have gone out chuckling, only Ruth
called after him: “Unc’ Rufus! Do you know if
there are any more candlesticks around the house?
Nice, heavy ones, I mean—good enough to put
in the dining room here, and for company to
see.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
</p>
<p>
“Candlesticks, missie? I ’spect dere is,” said
the old negro man.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know where?” Ruth asked quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Bress yo’, honey! I ‘speck dey is up in de attic,”
he said. “I don’ jes’ know whar—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know! I know!”  cried Agnes, suddenly.
“Over in that corner of the garret that we never
cleaned, Ruth.”
</p>
<p>
“Did we fail to clear up any part of the garret?”
asked the older girl, doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“The place Tommy Rooney hid in when he was
the attic goat,” Dot said solemnly.
</p>
<p>
“Ghost!” admonished Tess. “I do wish you’d
get your words right, Dot Kenway.”
</p>
<p>
“I remember seeing some old brass candlesticks
there,” Agnes went on to explain to Ruth. “They
can be polished, I should think. They’re all green
now.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said Ruth, cheerfully. “Let’s go
and look for them.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I want to go!” cried Dot, at once.
</p>
<p>
“May we all go, sister?” asked Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Of course you may come, kiddies,” said Agnes,
hopping down from her perch.
</p>
<p>
They all trooped up the three flights of stairs
to the huge garret, Dot leaving her “sleeping”
needle sticking in a puff-ball of popcorn.
</p>
<p>
The front hall of the old Corner House, as Milton
folk called the Stower homestead on the corner
of Willow Street, opposite the Parade Ground,
was two stories high.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
</p>
<p>
Broad stairs, dividing when half way up into
two separate flights, rose out of the middle of the
reception hall, lined with its old-fashioned, walnut,
haircloth furniture. A gallery ran all around
the stair-well, off which opened the guest chambers
of the house. Only one of these was in use. Aunt
Sarah Maltby had it. Aunt Sarah was determined
to have the best there was of everything.
</p>
<p>
The girls slept in rooms in one of the two ells,
on this second floor. Above, in the third story
of the same ell, slept Mrs. MacCall, their good
Scotch housekeeper, and Linda, the Finnish girl.
Uncle Rufus was stowed away in the other ell, in
a little room he had occupied for almost twenty-six
years. Uncle Rufus had been Uncle Peter
Stower’s only retainer for many, many years before
the Kenway girls came to live at the old
Corner House.
</p>
<p>
Up another flight of stairs, the girls trooped
to the garret, that extended the entire length and
breadth of the main portion of the house. This
was their playroom on rainy days, and a storeroom
of wonderful things. The Kenways had
never entirely exhausted the wonders of this place.
</p>
<p>
Agnes led the way to the far corner, lamp in
hand. There some Revolutionary uniforms hung
from the low rafters. On a broken-legged chest
of drawers, held up by a brick in place of the missing
leg, stood a row of heavy brass candlesticks.
</p>
<p>
“And see here!” cried Agnes, snatching up a
faded, fat, plush-covered volume, moth-eaten and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
shabby, from which Ruth had just removed two
of the candlesticks. “What can this be? The
family album, I declare!”
</p>
<p>
She flirted several of the leaves. Others stuck
together. There seemed to be some kind of illustrations,
or pictures, between the pages.
</p>
<p>
“Throw that dusty old thing down, Aggie,” said
Ruth, “and help me carry these heavy candlesticks.
They are just the things.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll help carry them,” agreed her sister.
“Here, Dottums. You can just about lug this old
book. I want to look at it. I shouldn’t wonder
if it held daguerreotypes and silhouettes of all the
Stowers since Adam.”
</p>
<p>
“What are da—da-gert-o-tops and—and silly-hats,
Aggie?” demanded Dot, toiling along at the
end of the procession with the big book, as the
four girls started down stairs again. “Are—are
they those awful animals Ruth was reading about
that used to in—infest the earth so long ago?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mercy me!” gasped Agnes, laughing.
“Pterodactyls and the giant sloth! See what it
means to tell these kids about the Paleozoic age
and ‘sich,’ Ruthie! Yes, child. Maybe you’ll find
pictures in that old book of those ‘critters,’ as
Mrs. Mac calls them.”
</p>
<p>
Dot sat right down on the upper flight and
spread the book out upon her small lap. She had
heard just enough about the creatures of the
ancient world to be vitally curious.
</p>
<p>
But there were no pictures of animals. Dot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
hurriedly turned the pages. In the back were engravings
on green paper, stuck into the old book.
The green slips of paper had pictures on them,
but nothing that interested Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Pooh!” she thought to herself, did the smallest
Corner House girl, “old money—that’s all it
is. Just like the money Mr. Howbridge gives
Ruth every month to pay bills with. I s’pose it’s
money that’s no good any more.”
</p>
<p>
She shut the book, disappointed, and clattered
down stairs after her sisters. Nobody else had
time to look at the family album just then. Agnes
tossed her “find” into a corner until some more
convenient occasion for looking at it. She and
Ruth got the metal cleaning paste and rags and a
chamois, and began to polish the candlesticks.
The smaller girls returned to the stringing of popcorn.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly they all stopped work. With upraised
hands and astonished looks, the four listened
for a repetition of the sound that had startled
them.
</p>
<p>
It came again, immediately. It was in the chimney.
There was a muffled shout, then a scratching
and a scraping, coming rapidly down the brick-and-mortar
tunnel.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! <em>Oh!</em> OH!” squealed Dot, in crescendo.
“Santa Claus has come ahead of time!”
</p>
<p>
“If that’s Santa Claus,” declared Agnes, jumping
up to run to the open fireplace, “he’s missed
his footing and is falling down the chimney!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—“A PERFECTLY SAVAGE SANTA CLAUS”</h2>
<p>
Mrs. MacCall put her head into the dining room
just as the girls rushed to the chimney-place to see
what the noise within it meant. The housekeeper
asked:
</p>
<p>
“Did you girls see that little imp, Sam Pinkney?
Linda says he came through the kitchen a while
ago, and when he heard you had gone to the garret
he went up the back stairs to find you.”
</p>
<p>
“Sammy Pinkney!” chorused the two smallest
Corner House girls.
</p>
<p>
“Well! it isn’t Santa then,” added Dot, with immense
relief.
</p>
<p>
“It’s that imp, sure enough!” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
And just then a sooty bundle bounced down
upon the hearth, to the unbounded amusement, if
not amazement, of the Kenway sisters and Mrs.
MacCall.
</p>
<p>
Ever since the Kenway girls had come to Milton
and the old Corner House, Sammy Pinkney had
been an abundant source of exasperation, amusement,
and wonder to them all—especially to Tess
and Dot.
</p>
<p>
Their coming to the Corner House, and all its
attendant adventure and mystery, is chronicled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
in the first book of the series, entitled “The Corner
House Girls.” The Kenways and Aunt Sarah
Maltby had been very poor in the city where
they had lived in a cheap tenement. All they had
for support was a small pension. Aunt Sarah
proclaimed always that when Peter Stower, of
Milton, who was her half brother, died, “they
would all be rich enough.” But that was only
“talk,” so Ruth thought.
</p>
<p>
One day, however, Mr. Howbridge, a lawyer,
came to see the orphans. He had been Uncle
Peter’s man of business and was now administrator
of the estate, Uncle Peter having died suddenly.
</p>
<p>
The lawyer told Ruth that he knew Uncle Peter
had left a will making the Kenway girls his heirs-at-law—and
leaving a very small legacy indeed to
Aunt Sarah. But Uncle Peter was queer, and
at the last had hidden the will. The lawyer said
the Kenways must come and occupy the old Corner
House in Milton until the will was found.
</p>
<p>
Aunt Sarah came with them of course. She
considered herself very badly used, and acted as
though she thought the best of everything in their
new station in life should be hers. The Court
made Mr. Howbridge the girls’ guardian, and the
four sisters lived a rather precarious existence at
the old Corner House for the first few months,
for they were not at all sure that they were in their
rightful place.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, when “the lady from Ypsilanti” with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
her little girl came along, and the lady claimed
that she and Lillie were Uncle Peter’s rightful
heirs, Ruth took them in and treated them kindly
in the absence of Mr. Howbridge, fearing that the
strangers might have a better claim upon the estate
than themselves.
</p>
<p>
Finally this Mrs. Treble (whom Agnes called
“Mrs. Trouble,” and her little girl, “Double
Trouble”) aroused Aunt Sarah’s antagonism. To
get them out of the house the queer old woman
showed Ruth where Uncle Peter Stower had been
wont to hide his private papers.
</p>
<p>
In this secret hiding place was the lost will. It
established the rights of the Corner House girls
to the estate and settled them firmly in the Stower
homestead.
</p>
<p>
In the second volume of the series, “The Corner
House Girls at School,” the girls extended the field
of their acquaintance, entered the local schools,
and became the friends, and finally the confidants,
of Neale O’Neil, the boy who had run away away from
Twomley &amp; Sorber’s Herculean Circus and Menagerie,
to get an education and “be like other
boys.”
</p>
<p>
Neale was not the only person the Corner House
girls befriended in this and the third book: “The
Corner House Girls Under Canvas.”  The latter
story relates their adventures at Pleasant Cove,
where they went for their vacation the second summer
of their sojourn in the old Corner House, and
during which time they were the means of reuniting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
Rosa Wildwood, one of Ruth’s schoolmates,
to her sister, June, who had been living
with a tribe of Gypsies.
</p>
<p>
Back again in the fall, and at school, Tess and
Dot chance to meet Mrs. Eland, matron of the
Women’s and Children’s Hospital, an institution
doing excellent work in Milton, but not much appreciated
by the townspeople at large. Tess quite
falls in love with Mrs. Eland and is horrified to
learn that the lonely woman is likely to lose her
position, and the hospital to be closed, because of
lack of funds.
</p>
<p>
Without any real idea of what she is accomplishing,
Tess Kenway goes about talking to anybody
and everybody of the hospital’s need. She completely
stirs up the town regarding the institution.
</p>
<p>
The schools take the matter up and the Board of
Education approves a plan for the pupils to give
a play for the benefit of the Women’s and Children’s
Hospital. Each member of the Corner
House quartette had a part in the play, and the
performances of <em>The Carnation Countess</em> had but
just been given during the fore part of this very
Christmas week.
</p>
<p>
The narrative of these recent occurrences may
be found in the fourth volume of the series, the
story immediately preceding this one, called “The
Corner House Girls in a Play.” Three thousand
dollars was raised for the hospital, and Mrs. Eland—Tess’
“little gray lady”—is assured of the continuation
of her situation as matron.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
</p>
<p>
This fact is particularly happy at this time, for
Mrs. Eland’s sister, Miss Pepperill, Tess’ school
teacher, is ill, and Mrs. Eland is nursing her back
to health. One reason for the decorating of the
Corner House dining room is that the reunited
sisters, Mrs. Eland and Miss Pepperill, have been
invited to eat their Christmas dinner with the
Corner House girls.
</p>
<p>
All this while the sooty bundle was lying on the
brick hearth at the feet of the startled Corner
House girls. As it squirmed, and the sooty dust
arose from it, they saw that it was certainly alive.
</p>
<p>
It wore a long cloak and a hood, now of a sooty
red, and trimmed with what was once white cotton-wool
“fur.” Leggings of the same material
and trimming covered a pair of stout nether limbs;
and upon these legs the little figure finally
scrambled, revealing at last to the Kenway sisters
and to Mrs. MacCall a face as black as any negro’s.
</p>
<p>
“For pity’s sake!” exclaimed the housekeeper.
“What d’ you call that, anyway?”
</p>
<p>
“It—it’s Sammy,” said Tess, boldly.
</p>
<p>
“If it is Santa Claus,” said Ruth, smiling, “it is
one that is not grown.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a perfectly savage one,” chuckled Agnes.
“This must be a young Santa Claus in his wild
and untamed state.”
</p>
<p>
“He is unfamiliar with the best methods of descending
folks’ chimneys, that is sure,” Ruth pursued.
“I don’t think this Santa Claus has learned
his trade yet.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
“And—and how black he is!” murmured Dot.
“Are—are <em>all</em> Santa Clauses so black?”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, you girls make me sick!” growled the
much abashed Santa Claus.
</p>
<p>
“I declare—he talks our language!” cried
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Why, of course,”  said Tess, the literal. “He’s
in my class at school, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“You think you are all so smart!” sneered Sammy
Pinkney, and that sneer was something awful
to behold. Dot fairly shuddered.
</p>
<p>
“You wait!” snarled Sammy. “When I run
away and get to be a pirate, I’ll—I’ll—I’ll—”
</p>
<p>
Sammy’s emotion choked him for the moment.
Mrs. MacCall sniffed; Ruth began to speak soothingly;
Agnes giggled; Tess looked her disapproval
of the savage young Santa Claus; while Dot, who
had caught up the Alice-doll and squeezed her
protectingly to her breast, gasped:
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Oh! Isn’t he dreadful?”
</p>
<p>
Sammy’s sharp ear evidently caught the smallest
Corner House girl’s whisper, for he rolled an
approving eye in Dot’s direction, and finally
finished his fearsome peroration with true piratical
savagery:
</p>
<p>
“I’ll come back and I’ll make every one of you
walk the plank!”
</p>
<p>
“What ever that may mean,” murmured Agnes,
quite weak from laughter. But as Sammy Pinkney
started for the door she cried: “Oh,
Sammy!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well? What’s the matter?” growled the savage
young Santa Claus.
</p>
<p>
“Tell us—do! How did you get in the chimney?”
asked Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“The skylight was open when I followed you
girls upstairs, so I got up on the roof and crawled
in at the top of the chimbley. It was all right coming
down, too,” said the young rascal, “till I got
to the second story. There was irons in the chimbley
for steps; but one was loose and fell out when
I stepped on it. Then I—I slipped.”
</p>
<p>
He stalked out. Dot said ruminatively: “We’d
better have that step fixed before to-morrow night,
hadn’t we, Ruthie? Before Santa Claus comes,
you know. He might fall and hurt himself.”
</p>
<p>
“Very true, Dottums,” declared Agnes, with a
quickly serious face. “I’ll speak to Uncle Rufus
about it.”
</p>
<p>
But Agnes must have forgotten, or else Uncle
Rufus did not attend to the missing step in the
chimney. At least, so Dot supposed when she
awoke in the dark the very next morning and heard
something going “thump-thumpity-thump” down
the chimney again.
</p>
<p>
The smallest Corner House girl was not in the
habit of waking up when it seemed still “the middle
of the night,” and her small head was quite
confused. She really thought it must be Christmas
morning and that good Kris Kringle has suffered
a bad fall.
</p>
<p>
“Oh-ee! if he’s brought Alice-doll her new carriage,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
it will be all smashed!” gasped Dot, and she
slipped out of bed without disturbing Tess.
</p>
<p>
She shrugged on her little bathrobe and put
her tiny feet into slippers. Somebody ought to go
to see how bad a fall Santa Claus had—and see if
all his presents were smashed. Dot really had
forgotten that there was still another day before
Christmas.
</p>
<p>
The little girl padded out of her room and along
the hall to the front of the house. Nobody heard
her as she descended the front stairs.
</p>
<p>
Dot came to the foot of the stairs, where a single
dim gaslight flickered. She pushed open the dining
room door.
</p>
<p>
As she did so, there sounded the faint clink,
clink, clink of metal against metal. A spotlight
flashed and roved around the room—touching ceiling
and walls and floor in its travels. But it did
not reveal her figure just inside the door.
</p>
<p>
She saw no good Kris Kringle standing on the
hearth, with his bag of toys. Nothing but a broken
brick lay there—probably loosened by Sammy
Pinkney in his course down the chimney-well the
previous afternoon.
</p>
<p>
There was a shadowy figure—she could not see
its face—stooping over a cloth laid upon the floor;
and upon that cloth was stacked much of the choice
old silver which Uncle Rufus always packed away
so carefully after using in the locked safe in the
butler’s pantry.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—DOROTHY’S BURGLAR</h2>
<p>
Dot Kenway had heard about burglars. That
is, she knew there were such people. Just why
they went about “burgling,” as she herself
phrased it, the smallest Corner House girl did not
understand.
</p>
<p>
But she thought, with a queer jumping at her
heart, that she had found a “really truly” burglar
now.
</p>
<p>
He was just putting their very best sugar-bowl
on the top of the pile of other silver, and she expected
to see him tie up the cloth by its four corners
preparatory to taking it away.
</p>
<p>
Dot really did not know what she ought to do.
Of course, she might have screamed for Ruth; but
then, she knew that Ruthie would be awfully scared
if she did.
</p>
<p>
Why, Tess, even, would be scared if she came
across a burglar! Dot was quite sure of that;
and she felt happy to know that she was really not
so scared as she supposed she would have been.
</p>
<p>
The burglar did not seem any more fearful in
appearance than the iceman, or the man who took
out the ashes, or the man who came to sharpen the
knives and had a key-bugle—
</p>
<p>
Oh! and maybe burglars carried something to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
announce their calling, like other tradesmen. The
junkman had a string of bells on his wagon; the
peanutman had a whistle on his roaster; the man
who mended tinware and umbrellas beat a shiny
new tin pan as he walked through Willow Street—
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” ejaculated the curious Dot, right out
loud, “do you use a whistle, or a bell, or <em>anything</em>,
in your business, please?”
</p>
<p>
My goodness! how that man jumped! Dot
thought he would fall right over backward, and the
round ray of the spotlight in his hand shot up to
the ceiling and all about the room before it fell
on Dot, standing over by the hall door.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” gasped the man, in
utter amazement. “Wha—what did you say,
miss?”
</p>
<p>
He was not really a man, after all. Dot saw by
his lean face that he was nothing more than a half
grown boy. So every little bit of fear she had felt
for the burglar departed. He could not really be
a journeyman burglar—only an apprentice, just
learning his trade. Dot became confidential at
once, and came closer to him.
</p>
<p>
“I—I never met anybody in your business before,”
said the smallest Corner House girl. “If
you please, do you only come into folks’s houses at
night?”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” croaked the young man, hoarsely.
“Seems ter me we’re workin’ both night an’ day
at this season. I never did see it so hard on a
poor feller before.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” exclaimed Dot. “Do you have busy
seasons, and slack seasons, like the peddlers?”
</p>
<p>
“I should say we did, miss,” agreed the other,
still in a complaining tone.
</p>
<p>
“My! What makes this time of year a busy
one?” demanded the inquisitive Dorothy.
</p>
<p>
“The frost, miss.”
</p>
<p>
“The frost?” repeated the little girl, quite puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, miss. The frost catches folks napping,
as ye may say.”
</p>
<p>
Dot puzzled over that for a moment, too. Did
folks sleep harder when it was frosty and dark
out-of-doors, than in summer? The young man
stood and watched her. It must be rather embarrassing
to be interrupted in the midst of a
burglary.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t—don’t mind me,” said Dot, politely.
“Don’t let me stop your work.”
</p>
<p>
“No, miss. I’m a-waiting for my boss,” said
the other.
</p>
<p>
There! Dot had known he must be only an apprentice
burglar—he was so young.
</p>
<p>
“Then—then there’s more of you?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“More of <em>me</em>? No, ma’am,” said the amazed
young man. “You see all there is of me. I never
was very husky—no, ma’am.”
</p>
<p>
He seemed to be a very diffident burglar. He
quite puzzled Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t—don’t you ever get afraid in your business?”
she asked. “I should think you would.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yep. I’m some afraid when I wipe a joint,”
admitted the young man. “Ye see, I ain’t used to
the hot lead, yet.”
</p>
<p>
Dot thought over that answer a good while. Of
course, she could not be expected to understand
the professional talk of burglars—never having
associated with that gentry. What “wiping a
joint” meant she could not imagine; and what
burglars did with hot lead was quite as puzzling.
</p>
<p>
“I—I suppose your boss is a journeyman burglar?”
queried the little girl, at last.
</p>
<p>
“Wha-at!” gasped the young man. Then he
grinned hugely. “That’s what some of his customers
calls him, miss,” he agreed.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t—don’t you think there is some danger
in your staying here alone?” asked Dot. “Suppose
Uncle Rufus should come down stairs and
catch you?”
</p>
<p>
“Hullo! who’s Uncle Rufus?” asked the young
man.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why, he’s Uncle Rufus. He works for
us—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! he’s the colored man?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, he <em>is</em> down,” said the young man, coolly.
“He let us in. We had to come early, ’cause we’ve
got so much work to do, and we didn’t get through
at Pinkney’s till nine o’clock last night.”
</p>
<p>
“At Pinkney’s?” cried Dot, as the young man
yawned. “Did—did you burgle Sammy’s house,
too?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
</p>
<p>
“What d’ye mean—‘burgle’?” asked the young
man, biting off the yawn and staring again at Dot.
</p>
<p>
“I beg your pardon,” said Dot, gently. “But—but
what do you call it?”
</p>
<p>
Just then the door of the butler’s pantry opened
and Uncle Rufus looked in.
</p>
<p>
“Dat oddah plumber done come, young man,”
he said. “Dis ain’t no time in de mawnin’—‘fo’
six o’clock—t’ come t’ folks’s houses nohow t’
mend a busted watah-pipe—nossir! Yuh got all
ob dem silber pieces out ob de safe?”
</p>
<p>
“They’re all out, Uncle,” said the young man.
</p>
<p>
“Whuffo’ dey run dat pipe t’rough de silber
closet, I dunno,” complained the old darkey. “I
use t’ tell Mistah Peter Stowah dat it was one piece
of plain foolishness. What if de bat’room <em>is</em> ober
dis closet—”
</p>
<p>
He disappeared, his voice trailing off into silence,
and the young man followed him. Dot was
left breathless and rather abashed. Then the
young man was not a burglar after all; he was only
a plumber!
</p>
<p>
She crept back to bed, and said nothing to anybody
about her early morning visit to the lower
floor. But the young man told Uncle Rufus, and
Uncle Rufus, chuckling hugely, told Mrs. MacCall.
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know, for goodness’ sake, what you
would have done if it had been a really truly burglar,
Dot Kenway?” Agnes demanded, when the
story was repeated at the breakfast table.
</p>
<p>
“I’d have given him my silver knife and fork
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
and mug, and asked him to go away without waking
up Ruthie,” declared the smallest Corner
House girl, having thought it all out by that time.
</p>
<p>
“I believe you would—you blessed child!” cried
Ruth, jumping up to kiss her.
</p>
<p>
“But suppose it had been Santa Claus?” Tess
murmured, “and you had disturbed him filling our
stockings?”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh!” said Dot. “If he’d felled down the
chimbley like that brick, he wouldn’t have been
filling stockings.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—THE FAMILY ALBUM—AND OTHER THINGS</h2>
<p>
The day before Christmas was the busiest day
of all. The dressing of the tree must be finished
and the trimming and festooning of the big dining
room completed. Neale O’Neil came over early to
help the Corner House girls. He was a slim, rosy-cheeked,
flaxen-haired boy, as agile as a monkey,
and almost always smiling.
</p>
<p>
Ruth and Agnes would not hear to his helping
trim the tree; but it was Neale’s agility that made
it possible for the rope of green to be festooned
from the heavy ceiling cornices. Uncle Rufus was
much too stiff with rheumatism for such work.
</p>
<p>
“Well! boys are some good, you must admit,”
Agnes said to Ruth, for the oldest Corner House
girl was inclined to be a carping critic of the “mere
male.”
</p>
<p>
“All right. If he’s so awfully useful, just let
him clear up all this mess on the carpet, and then
dust the rugs. Mercy, Agnes!” exclaimed Ruth,
“what a lot of this green stuff there is all over the
floor.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I know,” admitted Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“And there is other rubbish, too. Look at this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
old book you brought down from the attic and
flung in the corner.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth picked it up. It was heavy, and she carried
it over to the broad window-seat on which she
sat to open the “family album,” as Agnes had
called it.
</p>
<p>
The latter and Neale, having brought in basket
and broom, began to gather up the litter. Ruth
became very still at the window with the old volume
in her lap. The smaller girls were out of the
room.
</p>
<p>
“What’s in the old thing—pictures?” asked
Agnes of her elder sister.
</p>
<p>
“Ye—yes, pictures,” Ruth said hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>
“Must be funny ones,” chuckled Neale, “by
the look of her face.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth did look serious as she sat there, turning
the pages of the big, old volume. Had the others
noticed particularly they would have seen that the
countenance of the oldest Corner House girl had
become very pale.
</p>
<p>
It was so when Mrs. MacCall looked in and said
to her: “Oh, Ruth! I do wish you’d come out
here and see what that Sammy Pinkney’s brought.
I dunno whether to laugh, to scream, or to spank
him!”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be there in a moment, Mrs. Mac,” Ruth
said nervously, jumping up and closing the book.
</p>
<p>
Then she glanced at Agnes and Neale, seized the
volume in her arms, and instead of going out
through the butler’s pantry after Mrs. MacCall,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
she crossed the front hall to the sitting room at the
rear of the house.
</p>
<p>
“I like <em>that</em>!” cried Agnes. “Why! I found
that old album myself; and I haven’t had a chance
to look into it yet.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth was only a moment in the sitting room.
Then she ran to the kitchen and out upon the cold
porch, where Sammy Pinkney, done up in the folds
of a huge red comforter like a boa-constrictor suffering
from scarlet fever, stood, holding a cage-trap
in one mittened hand.
</p>
<p>
“What do you know about this?” demanded
Mrs. MacCall, spectacles on nose and eyeing the
contents of the round trap in alarm and disgust.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Rufus was chuckling hugely in the background.
Sandyface, the mother cat, was arching
her back and purring pleadingly about Sammy’s
sturdy legs.
</p>
<p>
“What are they?” demanded Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Mice,” grunted Sammy, gruffly. “For Tess’
cats. They like ’em, don’t they? But my mother
says I’ve got to bring the trap back.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s to be done with a boy like that?” demanded
Mrs. MacCall. “Being kicked to death
with grasshoppers would be mild punishment for
him, wouldn’t it? What’s to be done with eight
mice?”
</p>
<p>
“One kitten will have to go without,” said Dot,
the literal, as she and Tess joined the party on the
porch.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, now! You gotter let ’em out. I gotter have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
the trap,” was Sammy’s gruff statement.
He saw that his present was not entirely appreciated
by the human members of the Corner House
family, whether the feline members approved or
not.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ll call the family!” cried Dot, and raised
her voice in a shrill cry for “Spotty, Almira, Popocatepetl,
Bungle, Starboard, Port, Hard-a-Lee and
Mainsheet!” She was breathless when she had
finished.
</p>
<p>
Cats came from all directions. Indeed, they
seemed to appear most mysteriously from the
ground. Big cats and little cats, black cats and
gray cats, striped cats and spotted cats.
</p>
<p>
“If there were any more of them they’d eat us
out of house and home,” declared Mrs. MacCall.
</p>
<p>
“But Almira isn’t here!” wailed Dot. “Oh,
Ruthie! don’t let him open the cage till Almira
comes. <em>She</em> wants a chance to catch a mouse.”
</p>
<p>
“I believe you children are little cannibals!”
exclaimed the housekeeper. “How <em>can</em> you?
Wanting those cats to catch the poor little mice!”
</p>
<p>
“D’you want ’em for pets?” demanded Sammy,
grinning at the housekeeper.
</p>
<p>
“Ugh! I hate the pests!” cried Mrs. MacCall.
</p>
<p>
“Do find Almira, Ruthie,” begged Dot.
</p>
<p>
“I gotter take this cage back,” said Sammy.
“Can’t fool here all day with a parcel of girls.”
</p>
<p>
“But Almira—”
</p>
<p>
But Ruth had gone into the woodshed. She
peered into the corners and all around the barrels.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
Suddenly she heard a cat purring—purring hard,
just like a mill!
</p>
<p>
“Where are you, Almira?” she asked, softly.
</p>
<p>
“Purr! purr! purr!” went Almira—oh, <em>so</em> loud,
and <em>so</em> proudly!
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Almira?” asked Ruth. “There!
I see you—down in that corner. Why, you’re on
Uncle Rufus’ old coat! Oh! <em>What’s this?</em>”
</p>
<p>
The eight mice had been caught by the other cats
and killed. Tess came to the woodshed door.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruth,” she asked, “has anything happened
to Almira?”
</p>
<p>
“I should say there had!” laughed the oldest
Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! what is it?” cried Dot, running, too, to
see.
</p>
<p>
“Santa Claus came ahead of time—to Almira,
anyway,” declared Ruth. “Did you ever see the
like? You cunning ‘ittle s’ings! Look, children!
Four tiny, little, black kittens.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh-oh-ee!” squealed Tess, falling right down
on her knees to worship. But Dot looked gravely
at the undisturbed Sandyface, rubbing around her
feet.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me, Sandyface, you’re a grandmother!”
she said.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—NO NEWS FOR CHRISTMAS</h2>
<p>
Almira’s addition to the Corner House family
was not the only happening which came on this
eventful day to fill the minds and the hearts of the
Kenway sisters.
</p>
<p>
Ruth went around with a very serious face,
considering the holiday season and all that she
and Agnes and Tess and Dot had to make them
joyful. Nor was her expression of countenance
made any more cheerful by some news bluff Dr.
Forsyth gave her when he stopped, while on his
afternoon round of calls, to leave four packages
marked “Ruth,” “Agnes,” “Tess” and “Dot.”
</p>
<p>
“Not to be opened till to-morrow, mind,” said
the doctor. “That’s what the wife says. Now, I
must hurry on. I’ve got to go back to the hospital
again to-night. I’ve a bothersome patient there.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Not Miss Pepperill?” Ruth cried, for
the red-haired school teacher and the matron of
the hospital, her sister, were to be the guests of
the Corner House girls on the morrow.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Forsyth took off his hat again and frowned
into it. “No,” he said, “not her—not now.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Doctor! what do you mean? Isn’t she
getting on well?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well? No!” blurted out the physician. “She
doesn’t please me. She doesn’t get back her
strength. Her nerves are jumpy. I hear that she
was considered a Tartar in the schoolroom. Is
that right?”
</p>
<p>
“Ask Tommy Pinkney,” smiled Ruth. “I believe
she was considered strict.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! yes. Short tempered, sharp tongued,
children afraid of her, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“I believe so,” admitted Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Good reason for that,” said the doctor, shaking
his head. “Her nerves are worn to a frazzle.
I’m not sure that it isn’t a teacher’s disease. It’s
prevalent among ’em. The children just wear
them out—if they don’t take things easily.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Miss Pepperill?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t get her on her pins again,” growled
the doctor.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Doctor! Can’t she come over here with
her sister to-morrow?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, she’ll come in my machine,” said the good
physician, putting on his hat once more. “What
I am talking about is her lack of improvement.
She stands still. She makes no perceptible gain.
She talks about going back to teaching, and all
that. Why, she is no more fit to be a teacher at
present than I am fit to be an angel!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth smiled up at him and patted his burly
shoulder. “I am not so sure that you are not
an angel, Doctor,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. That’s what they tell me when I’ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
pulled ’em out of trouble by the very scruff of
their necks,” growled Dr. Forsyth. “Other times,
when I am giving them bad tasting medicine, they
call me anything but an angel,” and he laughed
shortly.
</p>
<p>
“But now—in this case—she’s not a bad patient.
She can’t help her nerves. They have gotten
away from her. Out of control. She’s not fit to
go back to her work—and won’t be for a couple of
years.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” cried Ruth, with pain. She knew what
such a thing meant to the two sisters at the hospital.
It was really tragic. Mrs. Eland’s salary
was small, and Miss Pepperill was not the person
to wish to be a burden upon her sister. “The
poor thing!” Ruth added.
</p>
<p>
“She ought to have a year—perhaps two—away
from all bothersome things,” said Dr. Forsyth,
preparing to go. “I’d like to have her go away,
and her sister with her for a time, to some quiet
place, and to a more invigorating climate. And
<em>that</em>—well, we doctors can prescribe such medicine
for our rich patients only,” and Dr. Forsyth went
away, shaking his head.
</p>
<p>
Ruth said nothing to the other girls about this
bad report upon Miss Pepperill’s condition. They
all were interested in Mrs. Eland’s sister—more
for Mrs. Eland’s sake, it must be confessed, than
because of any sweetness of disposition that had
ever been displayed by the red-haired school
teacher.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
The two women had lived very unhappy lives.
Left orphans at an early age, they were separated,
and Miss Pepperill was brought up by people who
treated her none too kindly. She was trained as a
teacher and had never married; whereas Mrs.
Eland was widowed young, had become a nurse,
and finally had come to be matron of the Milton
Women’s and Children’s Hospital in the very town
where her sister taught school.
</p>
<p>
The coming together of the sisters, after Miss
Pepperill was knocked down by an automobile on
the street, seemed quite a romance to the Corner
House girls, and they had been vastly interested
for some weeks in the affairs of the matron and the
school teacher.
</p>
<p>
The little girls, Tess and Dot, were too much excited
over what the eve of Christmas, and the day
itself should bring forth, to be much disturbed by
even Ruth’s grave face.
</p>
<p>
When they ate dinner that night, in the light
of the candles, it seemed as though they ate in a
fairy grotto. The big dining room was beautifully
trimmed, the lights sparkled upon the newly
polished silver and cut glass, a beautiful damask
tablecloth was on the board, and the girls in their
fresh frocks and ribbons were a delight to the eye.
</p>
<p>
Dot could not keep her eyes off the open fireplace.
Branches of pine had now been set up in
the yawning cavern of brick; but plenty of room
had been left for the entrance of a Santa Claus of
most excellent girth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
</p>
<p>
“Dot’s expecting another Santa—or a burglar—to
tumble down the chimney at any moment,”
laughed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Let us hope he won’t be a plumber,” said Ruth,
smiling gravely. “Another plumber’s bill at
Christmas would extract all the joy from our festivities.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! What will Mr. Howbridge say when he
sees the bill?” queried Agnes, round-eyed, for she
stood somewhat in awe of their very dignified
guardian.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t much care what he’ll say,” said Ruth,
recklessly. “Only I wish he were going to be with
us to-morrow as he was at Thanksgiving. But he
will not be back until long past New Year’s.”
</p>
<p>
Before they rose from the table the doorbell began
to ring and Uncle Rufus hobbled out to answer
it and to receive mysterious packages addressed to
the various members of the family. These gifts
were heaped in the sitting room, and Tess and Dot
were not even allowed a peep at them.
</p>
<p>
Neale came over and lit up the tree, to the delight
of the little girls. The Creamer girls from
next door came in to see it, and so did Margaret
and Holly Pease from down Willow Street.
</p>
<p>
Sammy Pinkney had been told he could come;
but the red comforter and the hoarse voice had not
been for nothing. Mrs. Pinkney sent over word
that Sammy had such a cold that she was forced
to put him to bed. He was feverish, too; so his
Christmas Eve was spent between blankets.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I’m so sorry for Sammy,” Dot said,
feasting her eyes upon the glittering tree. “I
know he won’t ever see anything so pretty as
this.”
</p>
<p>
“Not if he turns pirate, he won’t,” Tess agreed
severely. “I think likely his being sick is a punishment
for his saying that there isn’t any Santa
Claus.”
</p>
<p>
The visiting little girls went home and Tess and
Dot were sent off to bed. Not that they were
sleepy—oh, no, indeed! They declared that they
positively could <em>not</em> sleep—and then were in the
Land of Nod almost before their heads touched the
pillow.
</p>
<p>
Ruth kissed them both after she had heard their
prayers, and then tiptoed out of the room. Downstairs
was suppressed laughter and much running
about. Agnes and Neale were beginning to tie the
presents on the tree, and to fill the stockings hung
on a line across the chimney-place.
</p>
<p>
Everybody—even Uncle Rufus—had hung up a
stocking for Santa Claus to fill with goodies. It
had cost infinite labor and urging to get Aunt
Sarah to put her stocking in evidence for Kris
Kringle; but there it was, a shapeless white affair
with unbleached foot and top.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. MacCall’s hung next—rather a natty looking
black stocking, if the truth were known—one
of a pair, the mate to which had long since been
eaten by Billy Bumps, the goat.
</p>
<p>
Then came the girls’ stockings in one-two-three-four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
order, like a graduated course of bamboo
“bells.” Then followed one of Neale’s golf stockings,
which he had brought because it held more
than a sock, with Linda’s coarse red woollen hose
and Uncle Rufus’ huge gray yarn sock at the end.
</p>
<p>
It was great fun to fill the hose and to tie the
wonderfully curious packages on the tree and heap
them underneath it. Neale was to get all his presents
at the Corner House; so that added to the
confusion. There was a special corner in the sitting
room where Neale’s gifts had been hidden;
and there he was supposed not to look.
</p>
<p>
Then Agnes had to go into the kitchen while her
presents were being unearthed and properly hung.
Last of all, Ruth retired, leaving Agnes and Neale
to hang those gifts which the Good Saint had
brought the eldest sister. Ruth was tired, for she
had worked hard; so she went to sleep and had no
idea how long her sister sat up, when Neale went
home, or at what hour Mrs. MacCall locked the
house and went up to bed.
</p>
<p>
Agnes and Neale had something besides the
hanging of Ruth’s presents to interest them. The
former found the big, old family album hidden behind
the sewing machine in the sitting room. She
sat down with Neale to look it over.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—TREASURE TROVE</h2>
<p>
“Why! Did you ever!” gasped Agnes Kenway.
</p>
<p>
“Thought you said it was a family photograph
album!” said Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
With their heads close together they were looking
into the moth-eaten and battered book Agnes
had found in the old Corner House garret. On
turning the first page a yellowed and time-stained
document met their surprised gaze.
</p>
<p>
There was a picture engraved upon the document,
true enough. Such an ornate certificate, or
whatever it might be, Agnes or Neale had never
even seen before.
</p>
<p>
“‘The Pittsburg &amp; Washington Railroad Co.,’”
read Neale, slowly. “Whew! Calls for a thousand
dollars—good at any bank.”
</p>
<p>
“Sandbank, I guess it means,” giggled Agnes.
</p>
<p>
But Neale was truly puzzled. “I never saw a
bond before, did you, Aggie?”
</p>
<p>
“A bond! What kind of a bond?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, the kind this is supposed to be.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, is it a bond?”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! you repeat like a parrot,” snapped
Neale.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
“And you’re as polite as a—a pirate,” declared
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Well, did you ever see anything like this?”
</p>
<p>
“No. And of course, it isn’t worth the paper
it’s printed on. You know very well, Neale, that
people don’t leave money around—loose—like
<em>this</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“This isn’t money; it only calls for money,” said
the boy.
</p>
<p>
“I guess it never called very loud for it,” giggled
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Must be stage money, then,” laughed Neale.
“Hi! here’s more of it.”
</p>
<p>
He had turned a leaf. There was another of the
broad, important looking documents pasted in the
old book.
</p>
<p>
“And good for another thousand dollars!”
gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Phony—phony,” chuckled Neale, meaning that
the certificates were counterfeit.
</p>
<p>
“But just see how good they look,” Agnes said
wistfully.
</p>
<p>
“And dated more than sixty years ago!” cried
Neale. “There were green-goods men in those
days, eh? Hello! here’s another.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, we’re millionaires, Neale,” Agnes declared.
“Oh! if it were only real we’d have an
automobile.”
</p>
<p>
“This is treasure trove, sure enough,” her boy
chum said.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
</p>
<p>
“Whatever you find that seems to belong to nobody.
I suppose this has been in the garret for
ages. Hard for anybody to prove property now.”
</p>
<p>
“But it’s not <em>real</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes—I know. But, if it were—?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! if it were!” repeated the girl.
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t that be bully?” agreed the boy. But
he was puzzling over the mortgage bonds of a railroad
which, if it had ever been built at all, was
probably now long since in a receiver’s hands, and
the bonds declared valueless.
</p>
<p>
“And all for a thousand apiece,” Neale muttered,
turning the pages of the book and finding
more of the documents. “Cracky, Aggie, there’s
a slew of them.”
</p>
<p>
“But shouldn’t they be made out to somebody?
Oughtn’t somebody’s name to be on them?” asked
Agnes, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“No, guess not. These must be unregistered
bonds. I expect somebody once thought he was
awfully rich with all this paper. It totes up quite
a fortune, Aggie.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear!” sighed Agnes. “I guess it’s true,
Neale: The more you have the more you want.
When we were so poor in Bloomingsburg it seemed
as though if we had a dollar over at the end of the
month, we were rich. Now that we have plenty—all
we really need, I s’pose—I wish we were a little
bit richer, so that we could have an auto, Neale.”
</p>
<p>
“Uh-huh!” said Neale, still feasting his eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
on the engraved bonds. “Cracky, Aggie! there’s
fifty of ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! Fifty thousand dollars?”
</p>
<p>
“All in your eye!” grinned Neale. “What do
you suppose they ever pasted them into a scrap-book
for?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s just it!” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“What’s just it?”
</p>
<p>
“A scrap-book. I didn’t think of it before.
They made this old album into a scrap-book.”
</p>
<p>
“Who did?” demanded the boy, curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Somebody. Children, maybe. Maybe Aunt
Sarah Maltby might tell us something about it.
And it will be nice for Tess and Dot to play with.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” grunted Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Of course that’s it,” added the girl, with more
assurance. “It’s a scrap-book—like a postcard
album.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” grunted Neale again, still doubtful.
</p>
<p>
“When Mrs. MacCall was a little girl, she says
it was the fad to save advertising cards. She had
a big book full.”
</p>
<p>
“Well—mebbe that’s it,” Neale said grudgingly.
“Let’s see what else there is in the old thing.”
</p>
<p>
He began to flirt the pages toward the back of
the book. “Why!” he exclaimed. “Here’s some
real stage money. See here!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! oh!”
</p>
<p>
“Doesn’t it look good?” said Neale, slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Just as though it had just come from the bank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
What is it—Confederate money, Neale? Eva
Larry has a big collection of Confederate bills.
Her grandfather brought it home after the Civil
War.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! these aren’t Confederate States bills—they’re
United States bills. Don’t you see?” cried
Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!”
</p>
<p>
“But you can bet they are counterfeit. Of
course they are!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear!”
</p>
<p>
“Silly! Good money wouldn’t be allowed to lie
in a garret the way this was. Somebody’d have
found it long ago. Your Uncle Peter, or Unc’
Rufus—or <em>somebody</em>. What is puzzling me is why
it was put in a scrap-book.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! they’re only pasted in at the corners.
There’s one all loose. For ten dollars, Neale!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you go out and try to spend it, Aggie,”
chuckled her boy chum. “You’d get arrested and
Ruth would have to bail you out.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s just awful,” Agnes declared, “for folks
to make such things to fool other folks.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a crime. I don’t know but you can be
punished for having the stuff in your possession.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me! Then let’s put it in the stove.”
</p>
<p>
“Hold on! Let’s count it, first,” proposed
Neale, laughing.
</p>
<p>
Neale was turning the leaves carefully and counting.
Past the tens, the pages were filled with
twenty dollar bills. Then came several pages of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
fifties. Then hundred dollar notes. In one case—which
brought a cry of amazement to Agnes’ lips—a
thousand dollar bill faced them from the middle
of a page.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! goodness to gracious, Neale!” cried the
Corner House girl. “What does it mean?”
</p>
<p>
Neale, with the stub of a pencil, was figuring up
the “treasure” on the margin of a page.
</p>
<p>
“My cracky! look here, Aggie,” he cried, as he
set down the last figure of the sum. “That’s what
it is!”
</p>
<p>
The sum was indeed a fortune. The boy and
girl looked at each other, all but speechless. If
this were only good money!
</p>
<p>
“And it’s only good for the children to play
with,” wailed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Neale’s face grew very red and his eyes flashed.
He closed the book fiercely. “If I had so much
money,” he gasped, “I’d never have to take a
cent from Uncle Bill Sorber again as long as I
lived, I could pay for my own education—and go
to college, too!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Neale! couldn’t you? And if it were <em>mine</em>
we’d have an auto,” repeated Agnes, “and a man
to run it.”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh! <em>I</em> could learn to run it for you,” proposed
Neale. But it was plain by the look on his
face that he was not thinking of automobiles.
</p>
<p>
“Say! don’t let’s give it to the kids to play with—not
yet,” he added.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t know,” the boy said frankly. “But
don’t do it. Let me take the book.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! you wouldn’t try to pass the
money?” gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Huh! think I’m a chump?” demanded the boy.
“I want to study over it. Maybe I’ll show the
bonds to somebody. Who knows—they may still
be of some small value.”
</p>
<p>
“We—ell—of course, the money—”
</p>
<p>
“That’s phony—sure!” cried Neale, hastily.
“But bonds sometimes are worth a little, even
when they are as old as these.”
</p>
<p>
“No-o,” sighed Agnes, shaking her head. “No
such good luck.”
</p>
<p>
“But you don’t mind if I take the book?” Neale
urged.
</p>
<p>
“No. But do take care of it.”
</p>
<p>
So Neale took the old scrap-book home under his
arm, neither he nor Agnes suspecting what trouble
and worriment would arise from this simple act.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—“GOD REST YE, MERRIE GENTLEMEN”</h2>
<p>
There was a whisper in the corridor, a patter of
softly shod feet upon the stair.
</p>
<p>
Even Uncle Rufus had not as yet arisen, and it
was as black as pitch outside the Corner House
windows.
</p>
<p>
The old dog, Tom Jonah, rose, yawning, from his
rug before the kitchen range, walked sedately to
the swinging door of the butler’s pantry, and put
his nose against it. The whispering and pattering
of feet was in the front hall, but Tom Jonah’s old
ears were sharp.
</p>
<p>
The sounds came nearer. Tess and Dot were
coming down to see what Santa Claus had left
them. Old Tom Jonah whined, put both paws to
the door, and slipped through. He bounded
through the second swinging door into the dining
room just as the two smallest Corner House girls,
with their candle, entered from the hall.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Tom Jonah!” cried Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Merry Christmas, Tom Jonah!” shouted Dot,
skipping over to the chimney-place. Then she
squealed: “Oh-ee! He <em>did</em> come, Tess! Santa
Claus has been here!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well,” sighed Tess, thankfully, “it’s lucky
Tom Jonah didn’t bite him.”
</p>
<p>
Dot hurried to move a chair up to the hearth,
and climbed upon it to reach her stocking. The
tree was in the shadow now, and the children did
not note the packages tied to its branches.
</p>
<p>
Dot unhooked her own and her sister’s stockings
and then jumped down, a bulky and “knobby” hose
under each arm.
</p>
<p>
“Come on back to bed and see what’s in them,”
proposed Tess.
</p>
<p>
“No!” gasped Dot. “I can’t wait—I really
can’t, Tess. I just feel as though I should faint.”
</p>
<p>
She dropped right down on the floor, holding her
own stocking clasped close to her breast. There
her gaze fell upon a shiny, smart-looking go-cart,
just big enough for her Alice-doll, that had been
standing on the hearth underneath the place where
her stocking had hung.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! <em>oh!</em> OH!” shrieked Dot. “I know I shall
faint.”
</p>
<p>
Tess was finding her own treasures; but Tess
could never enjoy anything selfishly. She must
share her joy with somebody.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Dot! Let’s show the others what we’ve
got. And Ruthie and Aggie ought to be down,
too,” she urged.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s take our stockings upstairs and show
’em,” Dot agreed.
</p>
<p>
She piled her toys, helter skelter, into the doll
wagon. “My Alice-doll <em>must</em> see this carriage,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
she murmured, and started for the door. Tess
followed with her things gathered into the lap of
her robe. Tom Jonah paced solemnly after them,
and so the procession mounted the front stairs—Dot
having some difficulty with the carriage.
</p>
<p>
Ruth heard them coming and called out “Merry
Christmas!” to them; but Agnes was hard to
awaken, for she had been up late. The chattering
and laughter finally aroused the beauty, and she sat
up in bed, yawning to the full capacity of her “red,
red cavern with its fringe of white pearls all
around.”
</p>
<p>
“Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry
Christmas!” they all shouted at her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh—dear—me! Merry Christmas!” returned
Agnes. “But why be so noisy about it?”
</p>
<p>
“Come over here, Miss Lazybones,” cried Ruth,
“and see what Santa Claus has brought the children.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” demanded Agnes, as she hopped
out of bed. “Who’s going down the back stairs?”
</p>
<p>
“Linda,” said Ruth. “Can’t you tell those
clod-hopper shoes she wears? I wonder if everybody
in Finland wears such footgear?”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe she’s going to look at <em>her</em> stocking,”
Tess said. “I hope she likes the handkerchiefs I
monogrammed for her.”
</p>
<p>
But before long the pungent smell of freshly
ground coffee came up the back stairway and assured
the girls that the serving maid was at
work.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why so ear—ear—ear-ly?” yawned Agnes,
again. “Why! it’s still pitch-dark.”
</p>
<p>
Uncle Rufus was usually the first astir in the
Corner House and Linda was not noted for early
rising. But now the girls heard the stairs creak
again—this time under Mrs. MacCall’s firm tread.
</p>
<p>
“Merry Christmas, Mrs. Mac!” they all shouted.
</p>
<p>
The smiling Scotchwoman came to the door with
her bedroom candle in her hand.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, I hope ’twill be a merry ain for my
fower sweethearts,” she said. “Your Mrs. Mac
must have a kiss from ever’ ain o’ ye,” and she
proceeded to take toll from the quartette.
</p>
<p>
“Ye make ma heart glad juist wi’ the looks o’
ye,” she added. “And there’s many and many a
lonely heart beside mine ma Corner House bairns
have made to rejoice. I thank God for ye, ma
dearies.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. MacCall always spoke more broadly when
she was moved by sentiment. She wiped her
glasses now and prepared to descend to the kitchen
when suddenly a chorus of voices broke out below
the bedroom windows, in the side yard toward Willow
Street.
</p>
<p>
“Hech, now! what have we here?” cried the
housekeeper, going smartly to the window and
throwing up the shade and then the sash. The
sound poured in—a full chorus of fresh young
voices singing a Christmas carol.
</p>
<p>
“Cover yersel’s, ma dearies,” advised Mrs. MacCall,
“and leesten.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh!” whispered Agnes, fairly hugging herself
as she sat upon the bed with her feet drawn up.
“It’s just as though we lived in a castle—and had
a moat and drawbridge and fiefs—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” interposed Dot. “That’s Mr. Joe
Maroni strumming his guitar. I’ve heard him before.”
</p>
<p>
“Why!” gasped Ruth. “It’s the children from
Meadow Street.”
</p>
<p>
She ran to the window to peer out. It was a
very cold morning, and there was only a narrow
band of crimson, pink, and saffron light along the
eastern horizon.
</p>
<p>
She could easily distinguish the sturdy Italian
with his guitar which he touched so lightly in accord
with the children’s voices. There were fully
a dozen of the little singers—German and Italian,
Jew and Gentile—singing the praise of Christ our
Lord in an old Christmas carol.
</p>
<p>
A bulky figure in the background puzzled Ruth
at first; but when a hoarse voice commanded:
“Now sing de Christ-childt song—coom! Ein—zwei—drei!”
she recognized Mrs. Kranz, the
proprietor of the delicatessen store.
</p>
<p>
The lustily caroling children were some of
the Maronis, Sadie Goronofski and her half-brothers
and sisters, and other children of the tenants
in the Meadow Street property from which
the Corner House girls collected rents.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” murmured Agnes again. “Isn’t it
<em>great</em>? We ought to throw them largesse—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s that, Aggie?” demanded Dot. “It—it
sounds like a kind of cheese. Mr. Maroni sells
it.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no!” gasped Tess. “That’s gorgonzola—I
asked Maria. And—it—smells!”
</p>
<p>
“Goosey!” laughed Agnes. “Largesse is
money. Rich folks used to throw it to the poor.”
</p>
<p>
“My!” observed Dot. “I guess they don’t do
it now. Poor folks have to work for money.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s just dear of them to come and serenade
us,” Ruth declared. “But it’s so cold! Do call
them in to get warm, Mrs. Mac.”
</p>
<p>
Already the housekeeper was scurrying downstairs.
She had routed out Linda early to make
coffee against this very emergency, for Mrs. MacCall
had known that the Corner House girls were
to be serenaded on Christmas morning.
</p>
<p>
The four sisters dressed hastily and ran down to
greet their little friends from Meadow Street, as
well as Mrs. Kranz and Joe Maroni. The latter
had brought “the leetla padrona,” as he called
Ruth, his usual offering of a basket of fruit. Mrs.
Kranz kissed the Kenway girls all around, declaring:
</p>
<p>
“Posies growing de garten in iss nodt so sveet
like you kinder. Merry, merry Christmas!”
</p>
<p>
While the carol singers drank cups of hot coffee
the Corner House girls brought forth the presents
they had intended to send over to Meadow Street
later in the day, but now could give in person to
each child.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
</p>
<p>
The choristers went away with merry shouts
just at sunrise, and then Dot and Tess insisted that
the family should troop into the dining room to
take down the rest of the stockings.
</p>
<p>
Breakfast this morning was a “movable feast”
and lasted till nine o’clock. Nobody expected to
eat any luncheon; indeed, Mrs. MacCall declared
she could not take the time to prepare any.
</p>
<p>
“You bairns must tak’ a ‘bit in your fistie,’ as
we used to say, and be patient till dinner time,”
she said.
</p>
<p>
Dinner was to be early. Mrs. Eland and Miss
Pepperill came in the doctor’s automobile soon
after noon, and Tess and Dot were at once engaged
in entertaining these guests in the sitting room.
</p>
<p>
It was a real blessing to the little Corner House
girls, for it kept them out of the dining room, where
they could not keep their eyes off the heavily
laden tree, the fruit of which must not be touched
until after dinner.
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil had, of course, come over for his
stocking and had expressed his gratitude to his
friends at the old Corner House. But, as Ruth
had been glum the day before, so Neale was silent
now. Agnes became quite angry with him and sent
him home in the middle of the forenoon.
</p>
<p>
“And you needn’t come to dinner, sir—<em>nor
afterward</em>—if you can’t have a Christmas smile
upon your face,” she told him, severely.
</p>
<p>
It was while the preparations for dinner were in
full progress, that Ruth heard voices on the side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
porch. Rather, a voice, resonant and commanding
which said:
</p>
<p>
“Hear ye! hear ye! hear ye! I proclaim good
tidings to all creatures. Come! gather around me
and list to my word. I bear gifts, frankincense
and myrrh—”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me!” cried Agnes. “That’s Seneca
Sprague. And look at the cats!”
</p>
<p>
The girls ran out upon the porch to see a tall,
thin, gray-haired man, his abundant hair sweeping
his shoulders, dressed in a flapping linen duster
and with list slippers on his feet—a queer enough
costume indeed for a sharp winter’s day. But
Seneca Sprague was never more warmly clad than
this, and had been known to plod barefooted
through snowdrifts.
</p>
<p>
“Your humble servant, Miss Ruth,” said the
queer old man, doffing the straw hat and bowing
low, for he held the oldest Corner House girl in
much deference. “I came to bring you good cheer
and wish you a multitude of blessings. Verily,
verily, I say unto you, they that give of their substance
to the poor shall receive again a thousand
fold. May your cup of joy be full to overflowing,
Miss Ruth.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Mr. Sprague,” replied the girl,
gravely, for she made it a rule never to laugh at
the “prophet,” as he was called, and who people
said was demented upon religious subjects.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you for your good wishes,” said Ruth.
“And what have you brought the cats?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
</p>
<p>
For Sandyface and all her progeny had come
to meet the prophet and were purring about him
and otherwise showing much pleasure. Even Almira
had left her young family in the woodshed to
come to meet Mr. Seneca Sprague.
</p>
<p>
From a side pocket of his duster Seneca brought
forth a packet. He broke off a little of the pressed
herb in the packet and sprinkled it on the stoop.
The cats fairly scrambled over each other for a
chance to eat some of the catnip, or to roll in it.
</p>
<p>
They did not quarrel over it. Indeed, the intoxicating
qualities of their favorite herb gave the cats
quite a Christmas spirit.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. MacCall brought a shallow pan of milk and
some more of the herb was sprinkled in it by the
old prophet. The kittens—Starboard, Port, Hard-a-lee
and Mainsheet—lapped this up eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“It’s very kind of you to bring the catnip, Mr.
Sprague,” Ruth said. “Won’t you come in and
taste Agnes’ Christmas cake? She is getting to be
a famous cake baker.”
</p>
<p>
“With pleasure,” said the queer old man.
</p>
<p>
After Seneca Sprague’s old hut on the river dock
was burned at Thanksgiving, and the Corner
House girls had found him a room in one of their
tenements to live in, he had become a frequent
visitor at the old Corner House. Ruth would have
ushered him into the sitting room where Mrs.
Eland and her sister were; but Seneca shrank from
that.
</p>
<p>
“I am not a society man—nay, verily,” quoth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
the prophet. “The sex does not interest me.”
</p>
<p>
“But it is only Mrs. Eland and her sister, who
are our guests to-day for dinner,” Ruth said, as
she led him into the dining room, while Agnes sped
to get the cake.
</p>
<p>
“Ha! Those Aden girls,” said Seneca, referring
to the hospital matron and the red-haired
school teacher by their family name. “I remember
Lemuel Aden well—their uncle. A hard man
was Lemuel—a hard man.”
</p>
<p>
“I believe he must have been a very wicked
man,” declared Agnes, coming back with a generous
slice of cake, and overhearing this. “See how
he let people think that his brother was dishonest,
while <em>he</em> pocketed money belonging to the clients of
Mrs. Eland’s father. Oh! we know all about it.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah!” said Seneca again, tasting the cake.
“Very delicious. I know that you put none of the
fat of the accursed swine in your cake as some of
these women around here do.”
</p>
<p>
“Lard, he means,” whispered Ruth, for Seneca
followed the rabbinical laws of the Jews and ate
no pork.
</p>
<p>
“Lemuel Aden was a miser,” the prophet announced.
“He was worse than your uncle, Peter
Stower,” he added bluntly. “All three of us went
to school together. They were much older than I,
of course; but I came here to the Corner House to
see Peter at times. And I was here when Lem
Aden came last.”
</p>
<p>
“We know about that, too,” Agnes said, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
some eagerness. “Did—did Uncle Peter really
turn him out, and did he wander over into Quoharie
Township, and die there in the poorhouse?”
</p>
<p>
Seneca was silent for a minute, nibbling at the
cake thoughtfully. “It comes upon my mind,” he
said at last, “that Peter Stower was greatly
maligned about that matter. Peter was a hard
man, but he had soft spots in him. He was a great
sinner, in that he ate much meat—which is verily
against the commandment. For I say unto
you—”
</p>
<p>
“But how about Mr. Lemuel Aden and Uncle
Peter?” interrupted Ruth, gently; for the old
prophet was likely to switch off on some foreign
topic if not shrewdly guided in his speech.
</p>
<p>
“Ah! Lemuel Aden came back here to Milton
when he was an old man. Not so old in years, perhaps;
but old in wickedness, and aged beyond his
years by his own miserliness. We had heard he
was rich, but he declared he had nothing—had lost
everything in speculation; and he said all he possessed
was in the old carpetbag he brought.
</p>
<p>
“Peter Stower took him in,” Seneca continued.
“But Lemuel was a dirty old man and made that
colored man a lot of trouble. It was thought by
everybody that Lemuel Aden had even more wealth
than Peter Stower; but nobody ever knew of his
spending a penny. Peter said he had money; and
so finally turned him out.”
</p>
<p>
“How long did he stay here at the old Corner
House?” asked Ruth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
“Verily he would have remained until his end;
but Peter became angry with him and threatened
to hand him over to the town authorities. They
quarreled harshly—I was here at the time. The
colored man must have heard much of the quarrel,
too,” Seneca proceeded.
</p>
<p>
“I went away in the midst of it. Peace dwelleth
with me—yea, verily. I am not a man of wrath.
Later I learned that Lemuel Aden went away cursing
Peter Stower, and he was never more seen
again in Milton.”
</p>
<p>
“But was he poor?” Ruth asked. “Did Uncle
Peter turn him out to suffer?”
</p>
<p>
Seneca Sprague shook his head. “Nay; I would
not charge that to Peter Stower’s account,” he
said. “It was believed by everybody, as I say,
that Lemuel had much money hidden away. Peter
Stower said he knew it.”
</p>
<p>
“Just the same, he died in the Quoharie poorhouse,”
Agnes cried, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“He would have been cared for here in Milton
by the authorities had he asked help. Peter
Stower and Lemuel Aden were both misers. It
was said of them that each had the first dollar he
ever earned.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me!”  Ruth said, as the old prophet concluded.
“If Mr. Aden did have money at any
time, it is too bad Mrs. Eland can’t find it. She
and her sister need it now, if ever they did,” and
she sighed, thinking of Dr. Forsyth’s report upon
Miss Pepperill’s condition.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—WHERE IS NEALE O’NEIL?</h2>
<p>
Christmas Day wore away toward evening. A
number of the young friends of the Corner House
girls ran in to bring gifts and to wish Ruth and
Agnes and Tess and Dot a Merry Christmas.
Many of them, too, stayed for a moment to speak
to Mrs. Eland and Miss Pepperill. The interest
aroused by the recently performed play at the
Opera House for the benefit of the Women’s and
Children’s Hospital had awakened interest likewise
in “the little gray lady” and her sister.
</p>
<p>
“I never was so popular before with the school
children of Milton,” the latter said, rather tartly.
“I’d better be run down by an automobile about
once a year.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that would be dreadful!” Tess exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“It is a shame you don’t know who it was that
ran you down. He could be made to pay something,”
Ruth remarked.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness! Get money that I hadn’t
earned!” cried the school teacher.
</p>
<p>
“I should say you’d earned it—and earned it
mighty hard,” said Mrs. MacCall, who happened
to hear this.
</p>
<p>
“It wouldn’t be my fortune,” said Miss Pepperill,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
lying back wearily in her chair. “And I
don’t see how I can go back to those awful youngsters
after New Year.”
</p>
<p>
“Sh!” begged Mrs. Eland.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my! is our Tess an awful youngster?”
asked Dot, bluntly.
</p>
<p>
“She is a dear!” declared Mrs. Eland, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Theresa is an exception,” admitted Miss Pepperill.
“But I certainly have some little tikes in
my room.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know,” said Dot. “Like Sammy Pinkney.”
</p>
<p>
“Sammy’s sick abed,” Tess said, coming into
the room in time to hear his name mentioned. “I
went over and asked his mother about him. The
doctor won’t say what it is yet; but he’s out of his
head.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor Sammy!” said Agnes. “Falling down
our chimney yesterday was too much for him.
He’s an unfortunate little chap after all.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” Dot observed, “if he is sick and dies,
he’ll never get to be a pirate, will he?”
</p>
<p>
“Hear that child!” murmured Miss Pepperill,
eyeing Dot as though she were a strange specimen
indeed.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t speak so, Dottie,” admonished Tess.
“That would be dreadful!”
</p>
<p>
“What? Dreadful if he didn’t get to be a pirate?”
Agnes asked lightly.
</p>
<p>
But Tess was serious. “I don’t believe Sammy
Pinkney is <em>fit</em> to die,” she declared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
</p>
<p>
“For pity’s sake!” exclaimed Miss Pepperill.
“She talks like her grandmother. I never heard
such a child as you are, Theresa. But perhaps
you are right about Sammy. He’s one awful
trial.”
</p>
<p>
“But his mother was crying,” said Tess, softly.
</p>
<p>
Nobody said anything more to the tender-hearted
little girl; but Dot brought her the
nicest piece of “Christmas” candy in the dish—a
long, curly, striped piece, and Agnes hugged
her.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was worried a little about the dinner arrangements.
The meal was almost ready to serve,
but Neale O’Neil had not come over from Mr. Con
Murphy’s, where he lived.
</p>
<p>
“You were cross with him, Agnes, and he won’t
come back,” she said accusingly to the beauty.
“And Mrs. MacCall won’t wait.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he wouldn’t disappoint us!” declared
Agnes. “He knows we depend on him. Why,
half our fun will be spoiled—”
</p>
<p>
“He evidently isn’t coming to dinner.”
</p>
<p>
At that moment Uncle Rufus came to announce
that all was ready, and he tucked a twist of paper
into Agnes’ hand.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruthie! look here!” the second sister said.
“Read this.”
</p>
<p>
The oldest Corner House girl saw it was the
handwriting of their boy friend.
</p>
<p>
“‘Don’t worry. Santa Claus will appear according
to schedule.’ Oh! that is all right, then,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
Ruth said. “He’s not coming till after we get
through.”
</p>
<p>
“Well! I think that’s too mean of him,” cried
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
But Ruth was somewhat relieved. They went in
to dinner, a quiet, but really happy party.
</p>
<p>
The old dining room looked lovely, and the
lighted tree in the corner was a brilliant spectacle.
Ruth’s idea of lighting the room completely by
candles proved a good one. The soft glow of the
wax-lights over the ancient silver and sparkling
cut-glass was attractive.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. MacCall presided, as always. The girls
would not hear to her only directing the dinner
from the kitchen. Aunt Sarah Maltby, in her best
black silk and ivory lace, seemed to have imbibed
a share of the holiday spirit, for once at least.
She was quite talkative and gracious at the other
end of the table.
</p>
<p>
Without Neale O’Neil, Ruth found that the table
could be much better balanced. Mrs. Eland sat between
Tess and Dot on one side of the long board,
while Miss Pepperill’s place was between the two
older Corner House girls.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Rufus came in chuckling toward the close
of the meal and whispered something to Ruth. Almost
immediately she excused Tess and Dot to run
up for their dolls. The presents were to be taken
off the tree and there might be some for the Alice-doll
and Tess’ most treasured doll, too.
</p>
<p>
When the little folks returned something had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
disturbed the green boughs in the chimney-place.
Dot had only begun to eye that place of mystery
with growing curiosity, when there was a shaking
of the branches, two mighty thumps upon the brick
hearth, and pushing through the greenery came
Santa Claus himself.
</p>
<p>
“Merry Christmas! And the best of iv’rything
to ye!” cried the good saint jovially.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” gasped Dot. “Is—is it the <em>really
truly</em> Santa Claus?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe that Santa is Irish,” whispered
Tess. “This is just in fun!” But she could not
imagine, any more than did Dot, who it was behind
the mask and great paunch that disguised the
Santa Claus.
</p>
<p>
They all hailed him merrily, however. Even
Miss Pepperill and Aunt Sarah entered into the
play to a degree. Santa Claus went to the tree
and they all sat along the opposite side of the
cleared table, facing him. With many a quip and
jest he brought the packages and presented them to
those whose names were written on the wrappers.
At one place quite a little pile of presents were
gathered, all addressed to Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” sighed Tess, almost overcome
with joy, yet thinking of the absent one. “If
Neale were only here! I do so want to see how he
likes his presents.”
</p>
<p>
But Neale did not come. The two little girls
finally tripped up to bed with their arms full.
Then the party broke up and the masquerading
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
Santa Claus took off his paunch and false face in
the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
“Shure I promised the lad I’d do it for him,”
said Mr. Con Murphy, accepting a piece of Agnes’
cake and sitting down to enjoy it. “No, he’s not
mad wid yez. Shure not!”
</p>
<p>
“But why didn’t he come to dinner?” demanded
Agnes, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“He ain’t here,” said the cobbler, quietly.
“He’s gone away.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean he’s gone away from your
house?” asked Ruth, curiously, for Agnes was too
much surprised to speak.
</p>
<p>
“Shure, he’s gone away from Milton entirely,”
said the little Irishman.
</p>
<p>
“What for?” demanded both girls together.
</p>
<p>
“Begorra! he didn’t say, now,” said Mr. Murphy,
slowly. “Come to think of ut, he niver told
me. But I knowed the letter puzzled him.”
</p>
<p>
“What letter?” asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“He never told me he got a letter,” cried Agnes,
much put out.
</p>
<p>
“It was there last evening when he got home.
The postman brought it jest before supper,” said
Mr. Murphy, reflectively. “Ye, see, Neale was
over here all the evening and shure, he didn’t see
the letter till he come home.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” was the chorused exclamation.
</p>
<p>
“I see he was troubled in his mind this mornin’,”
said the cobbler. “‘What’s atin’ on yer
mind, lad?’ says I to him. But niver a wor’rd did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
he reply to me till afther he’d been over here and
come back again. Then he came downstairs with
his bist clo’es on and his bag in his hand.”
</p>
<p>
“For pity’s sake!” wailed Agnes, “where has
he gone?”
</p>
<p>
“He didn’t say,” returned the old Irishman,
shaking his head. “Neale can be as tight-mouthed
as a clam—so he can.”
</p>
<p>
“But he did not go off without saying a word to
you?” cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“No, not so. He says: ‘Con, I’ve gotter go.
’Tis me duty. I hate mesilf for going; but I’d
hate meself worse if I didn’t go.’ Now! kin ye
make head nor tail of that? For shure, I can’t,”
finished the cobbler.
</p>
<p>
The two Corner House girls stared at each other.
Neither of them could see into this mystery any
deeper than did Mr. Con Murphy.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—RUTH IS SUSPICIOUS</h2>
<p>
The day following Christmas Ruth went out of
her way while she was marketing to step into the
bank in which Mr. Howbridge kept their account,
and where she was known to both the cashier and
teller.
</p>
<p>
“Good morning, Mr. Crouch,” she said to the
latter gentleman. “Will you look at this bill?”
</p>
<p>
“Merry Christmas to you, Miss Ruth,” said the
teller. “What is the matter with the bill?” and
he took the one she tendered him.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you can tell me better than I can tell
you,” Ruth returned, laughing; yet she looked a
bit anxious, too, and her hand trembled.
</p>
<p>
“Has somebody been giving you a ‘phony’ ten
dollar note?” asked the teller, taking up his glass
and screwing it into his eye.
</p>
<p>
“I am not sure,” replied Ruth, hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>
“Or is it a Christmas present and you are looking
a gift horse in the mouth?” and Mr. Crouch
chuckled as he bent above the banknote. “This
appears to be all right. Do you want it broken—or
changed for another note?”
</p>
<p>
“No-o. I guess not. I only wanted to be sure,”
Ruth said. “Of course you can’t be mistaken,
Mr. Crouch?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mistaken? Of course I can,” he cried. “Did
you ever hear of a mere human who wasn’t sometimes
mistaken?” and he laughed again.
</p>
<p>
“About that being a good bill, I mean,” she
said, trying to laugh with him.
</p>
<p>
“I’m so sure that I’m willing to exchange good
money for it,” he said, with confidence. “I can
say no more than that.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth gravely folded the bill again and tucked it
into one compartment of her purse, by itself. She
looked very serious all the way home with her
laden basket.
</p>
<p>
While the eldest Corner House girl was absent
Tess and Dot had been very busy in their small
way. Life was so “full of a number of things”
for the two smallest Corner House girls that they
were seldom at a loss for something to do.
</p>
<p>
First of all that morning Tess insisted upon calling
at the Pinkneys’ side door to ask after Sammy.
She felt it her duty, she said.
</p>
<p>
When they approached the porch Dot’s quick
eyes caught sight of a brilliantly red card, about
four inches square, tacked to the post.
</p>
<p>
“What do you suppose that is, Tess Kenway?”
she demanded, stopping short.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! what does it say?” responded Tess,
puzzled for the moment.
</p>
<p>
“Why! it looks just like what was tacked on the
front door of the Creamers’ house when Mabel’s
sisters had quarantine. Don’t you ‘member?”
demanded Dot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” cried Tess. “It’s scarlet fever.
Then Sammy’s really got it!”
</p>
<p>
“Is—is it catching?” asked Dot, backing away
and hugging tighter her Alice-doll, which she had
snatched out of the carriage.
</p>
<p>
“I—guess—so,” said Tess. “Oh, poor
Sammy!”
</p>
<p>
“Do you ‘spect he’ll <em>die</em>?” asked Dot, in awed
tone.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, goodness me! I don’t know!” exclaimed
Tess.
</p>
<p>
“And won’t he ever grow up to be a pirate?”
queried Dot, for to the mind of the smallest Corner
House girl romance gilded Sammy Pinkney’s proposed
career.
</p>
<p>
“Scarlet fever’s dreadful bad. And we mustn’t
go in,” Tess said.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry for Sammy,” observed Dot. “I
think he’s a terrible int’resting boy.”
</p>
<p>
“You shouldn’t be interested in the boys,” declared
prudish Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Huh! <em>you</em> wanted to come here to see how he
was,” responded the smallest Corner House girl,
shrewdly.
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t think of him as a <em>boy</em>. I’m just
sorry for him ’cause he’s a human being,” declared
Tess, loftily.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!”
</p>
<p>
“I’d be sorry for anybody who had scarlet
fever.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Dot said, rather weary of the subject,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
“let’s go over to see Mabel Creamer. Now we’re
out with our doll carriages, we ought to call somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
Tess agreed to this and the little girls wheeled
their baby carriages around the corner to their
next door neighbor’s, on the other side of the old
Corner House.
</p>
<p>
The Creamer cottage seemed wonderfully quiet
and deserted in appearance as they went in at the
gate and pushed their doll carriages up to the side
porch.
</p>
<p>
“Do you s’pose they’re all away?” worried
Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe they’ve got the scarlet fever, too,” murmured
Dot, in awe.
</p>
<p>
But just then a figure appeared at the sitting
room window which, on spying the Corner House
girls, began to jump up and down and make urgent
gestures for them to come in.
</p>
<p>
“It’s Mabel,” said Tess. “And she must be all
alone.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, goody! then her sisters can’t boss us,”
cried Dot, hurrying to drag her Alice-doll’s new
go-cart up the steps.
</p>
<p>
Mabel, the Creamer girl nearest the little Kenways’
own ages, ran to open the door.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, hurrah!” she cried. “Come in, <em>do</em>! Tess
and Dot Kenway. I’m so lonesome I could kill
flies! Dear me! how glad I am to see you,” and
she hugged them both and then danced around
them again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
“Are you all alone, Mabel?” asked Dot, struggling
with her hood and coat in the warm hall.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Minnie” (that was the maid’s name)
“has just run down to the store. She won’t be
gone long. But I might as well be all alone.
Mother’s gone to Aunt Em’s and Lydia’s taken
Peg to have a tooth pulled.”
</p>
<p>
“But the baby?” asked Tess. “Didn’t I just
hear him?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” said Mabel, scowling. “I’ve got to
mind the baby. I told Lydia <em>I’d</em> go have a tooth
pulled and Peg could mind him. I’d rather.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” cried Dot, in awe, while Tess marched
straight into the sitting room to see if the Creamers’
youngest was all right.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t deserve to have a baby brother,
Mabel Creamer,” Tess said severely.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I wish we could have one!” Dot said longingly.
</p>
<p>
“Say! you can have this one for all I care,” declared
Mabel. “You don’t know what a nuisance
babies are. Everybody else can go out but me.
I’ve got to stay and mind the baby. Nasty thing!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mabel!” said Tess, sorrowfully—for Tess
had no objection to boys as small as Bubby
Creamer. The baby laughed, and crowed, and
stretched out his arms to her. “Isn’t he the cunning
little thing, Dot?” cooed Tess.
</p>
<p>
“He’s the nicest baby I ever saw,” agreed the
smallest Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” growled Mabel, who had been the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
baby in the family herself for a long time before
Bubby came. “Oh, yes, he’s so cunning! Look
at him now—trying to get his foot in his mouth.
If I bite my fingernails mother raps me good; but
that kid can swallow his whole foot and they think
he’s cute!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mabel! does he really swallow his foot?”
gasped Dot. “I should think it would choke him.”
</p>
<p>
“Wish it would!” declared the savage sister of
the cooing Bubby Creamer. “Then I could get out
and play once in a while. Lydia and Peg put it
on me, anyway. They get the best of everything.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let’s play right here,” suggested Tess, interrupting
this ill-natured tirade. “You get your
new doll, Mabel.”
</p>
<p>
“No. If I do <em>he’ll</em> want it. See! he’s trying to
grab your Alice-doll right now, Dot Kenway.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! he can’t have <em>her</em>,” Dot gasped, in alarm.
“Haven’t you an <em>old</em> dolly you can let him play
with, Mabel?”
</p>
<p>
“He’s got one of his own—a black boy. As
black as your Uncle Rufus. I’ll hunt around for
it,” said the ungracious Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Afterward, when the little Kenways were on
their way home, after bidding Mabel and Bubby
good-bye, Dot confessed to her sister:
</p>
<p>
“I don’t so much like to go to see Mabel
Creamer, after all. She’s always so scoldy.”
</p>
<p>
“I know,” agreed Tess. “And she’s real inquisitive,
too. Did you hear her asking ’bout
Neale?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t notice,” Dot said.
</p>
<p>
“Why, she says they saw Neale O’Neil going
through our yard with a heavy traveling bag yesterday
morning, and he went out our front gate.
She asked where he was going.”
</p>
<p>
“But you don’t know where Neale has gone,”
said Dot, complacently, “so she didn’t find out
anything. And <em>I’d</em> like to know where he’s gone,
too. There’s all his presents off the Christmas
tree; and we can’t see them till he comes back,
Ruthie says.”
</p>
<p>
More than Dot expressed a desire to see Neale
at the old Corner House. Agnes had gone about
all the morning openly wondering where Neale
could have gone, and what he had gone for.
</p>
<p>
“I think he’s just too mean for anything,” she
said to Ruth, querulously, when the older girl came
home from market.
</p>
<p>
“Who is mean?” Ruth returned absently.
</p>
<p>
“Neale. To go off and never say a word to us.
I am offended.”
</p>
<p>
Had Agnes’ mind not been so strongly set upon
the subject of Neale O’Neil’s defection she would
surely have noticed how Ruth’s hands trembled
and how her face flushed and paled by turns.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind about Neale O’Neil,” the older sister
said, rather impatiently for her.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I just do mind!” Agnes declared. “He
has no business to have secrets from us. Aren’t
we his best friends?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he doesn’t consider us such,” said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
Ruth, who would have been amused by her sister’s
seriousness at another time. “There’s Joe Eldred.
Perhaps he knows where Neale has gone.”
</p>
<p>
“Joe Eldred!” cried Agnes. “If I thought
Neale had taken a mere boy into his confidence and
hadn’t told me, I’d never speak to him again! At
least,” she temporized, knowing her own failing,
“I never would forgive him!”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind worrying about Neale,” Ruth said
again. “Come into the sitting room. I want to
show you something.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes followed her rather grumpily. To her
mind there was nothing just then so important as
Neale O’Neil’s absence and the mystery thereof.
</p>
<p>
Ruth turned to her when the door was closed
and started to open her purse and her lips at the
same time. Her eyes sparkled; her cheeks were
deeply flushed. She looked just as eager and excited
as ever quiet, composed Ruth Kenway could
look.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aggie!” she quavered.
</p>
<p>
“Well!” said Agnes, querulously. “I don’t
care. He—”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind Neale O’Neil!” cried Ruth, for a
third time, and quite exasperated with her sister.
</p>
<p>
She closed her purse again and ran across the
room. She looked behind the machine. Then she
pulled the machine away from the wall so that she
could get down on her knees and creep behind it.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with you, Ruthie?” asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
Agnes, finally awakening to her sister’s strange
behavior. “What are you looking for?”
</p>
<p>
“Where—where is it? Where has it gone?”
gasped Ruth, still on hands and knees.
</p>
<p>
“What <em>are</em> you after, Ruth Kenway?” cried
Agnes again. “Oh! are you looking for that old
scrap-book I found upstairs in the garret?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Ruth, quaveringly.
</p>
<p>
“Why? Did you see what was in it?” demanded
her sister.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Ruth said again.
</p>
<p>
“Wasn’t it funny? All that counterfeit money
and those old bonds. Neale and I looked at it
Christmas Eve.”
</p>
<p>
“Neale?” gasped Ruth, getting upon her feet,
but sitting down in a chair quickly as though her
knees were too weak to bear her up.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” rattled on Agnes. “Wouldn’t
it have been <em>great</em> if the money and bonds were
good? Why! it would have been a fortune.
Neale added it all up.”
</p>
<p>
“But what became of the book?” Ruth finally
got a chance to ask again.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Neale took it.”
</p>
<p>
“Neale took it?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“What for?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, I don’t know. He was curious. He said
maybe the bonds were worth something and he’d
find out. Of course, that is silly,” said Agnes,
lightly, “and I told him so.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
</p>
<p>
“And didn’t he bring all that money back?”
gasped Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“‘All that money,’” repeated Agnes, with
laughter. “How tragic you sound—just as though
it were not stage money. And I wish it were
not!”
</p>
<p>
“He—he didn’t return the book?” asked Ruth,
controlling herself with difficulty.
</p>
<p>
“Not yet. He went away so suddenly. Mean
thing! I’d just like to know where he’s gone.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes was quite unaware of her sister’s trouble.
Her own mind reverted to Neale’s strange absence
as of more importance. Ruth began to be troubled
by that same query, too. Where <em>was</em> Neale
O’Neil? And what had he done with the old album
found in the Corner House garret?
</p>
<p>
The ten dollar bill Ruth had had examined at the
bank that morning was one she had taken out of
the old volume!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—WHAT MR. CON MURPHY DID NOT KNOW</h2>
<p>
The children saw Dr. Forsyth coming out of
Sammy Pinkney’s house that afternoon and they
ran to ask him how their neighbor was getting on.
</p>
<p>
“For we’re awful int’rested in Sammy,” Dot
explained. “I’m int’rested because he’s going to
be a pirate, and Tess is int’rested because he gave
her a goat.”
</p>
<p>
“You children stay across the street where you
are,” commanded the busy doctor, getting briskly
into his automobile. “You’re quite near enough
to me. This is my last call and I’m going home
now to fumigate my clothing.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” cried Dot, “has Sammy scarlet
fever and quarantine, <em>both?</em>”
</p>
<p>
“Huh?” said the doctor, trying his starter.
Then he laughed. “I should say he had. And
you children must stay away from there. It’s bad
enough to have one scarlet fever patient on Willow
Street. I don’t want an epidemic.”
</p>
<p>
That last puzzled Dot a good deal. She went
back into the house very soberly when the doctor
drove away.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. MacCall,” she asked, “what is a epidermis?
Dr. Forsyth doesn’t want one.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, that’s ‘no skin off your nose,’ Dot,”
said Agnes, giggling at her own fun.
</p>
<p>
“If the doctor had no epidermis he’d be a rare
lookin’ object,” said the housekeeper, “for that’s
his skin, just as your sister says.”
</p>
<p>
“He said ‘epidemic,’” Tess declared, with disgust.
“Dot! you do make the greatest mistakes.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, has Sammy got <em>that</em> too?” cried Dot,
horrified by the possibility of such a complication
of diseases. “Has he got scarlet fever, and quarantine,
and ep—epic—well, that other thing,
too?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth came through the kitchen dressed to go
out. Her face was very grave and her eyes suspiciously
red; but she pulled her veil down over
her face and so hid the traces of her emotion from
the family.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you going, Ruthie?” asked Dot,
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Sister’s going out on an errand,” replied Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! let me go?” cried the smallest Corner
House girl.
</p>
<p>
“Not this time,” said Ruth, quietly. “I can’t
take you to-day, Dot.”
</p>
<p>
Dot began to pout. “Oh, come along, Dot,”
said Tess, who never could bear to see her little
sister with a frown. “Let us go upstairs and
dress all the dolls in their best clothes, and have a
party.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Dot. “I can’t. Muriel has spoiled
her party dress. She spilled tea on it, you know.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
Bonnie-Betty’s broken her arm and it’s in splints.
And you know Ann Eliza and Eliza Ann, the twins,
are all spotted up, and I don’t know yet whether
it’s measles or smallpox.”
</p>
<p>
“For goodness’ sake!” gasped Mrs. MacCall.
“If they need a quarantine anywhere I should
think ’twould be in that nursery.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth went out, leaving them all laughing at Dorothy.
She was in no mood for laughter herself.
Since she and her sisters had come to live at
the old Corner House, Ruth had never felt more
troubled.
</p>
<p>
She said nothing further to Agnes either about
the absence of Neale O’Neil, or the disappearance
of the old album. The next to the oldest Corner
House girl had noted nothing strange in Ruth’s
manner or speech. Agnes Kenway was not very
observant.
</p>
<p>
Ruth went out the side gate and along Willow
Street. Beyond Mrs. Adam’s little cottage there
was a narrow lane called Willow Wythe, which ran
back, in a sort of L-shaped passage to the rear
street on which Mr. Con Murphy had his tiny house
and shop.
</p>
<p>
Neale always came to the Corner House by a
‘short cut’—over the fence into the back premises
from Mr. Murphy’s yard; and Agnes had been
known to come and go by the same route. It was
several minutes’ walk by way of Willow Street and
Willow Wythe to the door of the cobbler’s little
shop.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
</p>
<p>
Neale O’Neil had lived here with Mr. Murphy,
occupying an upstairs room, almost ever since he
had come to Milton to go to school. Mr. Murphy’s
pig had served as an introduction between
Neale and the cobbler. Mr. Murphy always
thought a good deal of his pig. Later he thought
so much of Neale that he offered to buy the boy’s
services from his Uncle Bill Sorber, when that gentleman
had tried to take Neale back to the circus.
</p>
<p>
“Shure,” Mr. Murphy had said, “there’s more
to a bye than to a pig, afther all—though there’s
much to be said in favor of the pig, by the same
token!”
</p>
<p>
However, either the cobbler’s generosity, or
something else, had shamed Mr. Sorber into agreeing
to let Neale have his chance for an education;
and he was willing to pay the boy’s expenses while
he went to school, too. But Neale worked hard to
help support himself, for he disliked being a burden
on his uncle.
</p>
<p>
The old cobbler was a queer character, but with
a heart of gold. He tapped away all day at the
broken footgear of all the neighbors, ever ready
for a bit of gossip, yet exuding a kindly philosophy
all his own in dealing with neighborhood topics, or
human frailties in general.
</p>
<p>
“There’s so little good in the best of us, and so
little bad in the worst of us, that it behooves the
most of us to take care how we speak ill of the rest
of us,” was the sum and substance of Mr. Con
Murphy’s creed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
</p>
<p>
“Happy the day when yer shadder falls across
the threshold, Miss Ruth,” was the Irishman’s
greeting as she pushed inward the door of his shop
which was in what had been the parlor of the tiny
house. “Bless yer swate face! what’s needed?”
</p>
<p>
“We want to know what’s become of Neale,
Mr. Murphy,” said Ruth, sitting down in the customer’s
chair.
</p>
<p>
“Shure, miss, as I told ye, I’d like to l’arn that
same meself.”
</p>
<p>
“You have no idea where he’s gone?”
</p>
<p>
“Not the laist. He give me no warnin’ that he
was thinkin’ of goin’ till he walked downstairs, wid
the travelin’ bag in his hand, and bade me
good-bye.”
</p>
<p>
“And he said nothing about where he was going?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a wor-rd.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor how long he would stay?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a wor-rd.”
</p>
<p>
“Well!” cried Ruth, with some vigor, “it is the
strangest thing! How could he act so? And you
have been so kind to him!”
</p>
<p>
“He was troubled in his mind, Miss Ruth. I
kin see you are troubled in yours. Kin old Con
help ye?” asked the cobbler, shrewdly.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” Ruth said, all of a flutter. “I
am dreadfully anxious about Neale O’Neil’s going
away so abruptly.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s a smart boy for his age. He’ll get into
no trouble, I belave.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m not so much disturbed by that thought,”
admitted Ruth. “I am really selfish. I want to
see him. Agnes let Neale take something we
found in our garret, on Christmas Eve, and—and—well,
it’s something valuable, I believe, and I
must show it to Mr. Howbridge as soon as possible.”
</p>
<p>
“Something vallible, is ut?” observed Mr. Murphy,
with his head on one side.
</p>
<p>
“I—I have reason to believe so,” replied Ruth,
with hesitation.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” was the cobbler’s direct question.
</p>
<p>
“A—a sort of scrap-book. An old album. A
big, heavy book, Mr. Murphy. Oh! it doesn’t seem
possible that Neale would have taken it away.
Have you seen it anywhere about, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“He brought it home Christmas Eve, ye say?”
was the noncommittal reply.
</p>
<p>
“That is when Agnes let him have it—yes,”
said the girl, earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“I did not see him when he came home that
night. I was abed. I told ye he got a letter. I
left it on his bureau when I went to me own bed.
Shure, he might have brought in an elephant for
all I’d knowed about it afther I got to sleep,” declared
the cobbler, shaking his head. “Old Murphy-us
himself, him as was the god of sleep, niver
slept sounder nor me, Miss Ruth. He must have
been the father of all us Murphies, for we were all
sound sleepers, praise the pigs!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps the book is in his room,” Ruth said,
with final desperation.
</p>
<p>
“A big book, is ut?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, sir. Have you seen it?”
</p>
<p>
“I have not. But I’ll go up and look for ut this
instant,” Mr. Murphy said, rising briskly.
</p>
<p>
Ruth told him carefully what to look for—as far
as the outside of the volume appeared. She devoutly
hoped he would not be curious enough to
open it.
</p>
<p>
For no matter who really owned the old album—and
to whom its wonderful contents would be
finally awarded—the oldest Corner House girl felt
herself to be responsible for the safety of the book
and its contents. How it came in the garret, why
it was hidden there, and who now had the first
right to it, she did not know; but Ruth was sure
that the odd find was of great value and that it
would be a temptation to almost anybody.
</p>
<p>
Neale might have gone away for an entirely different
reason; yet he had the treasure trove in his
possession last, and Ruth would not feel relieved
until she had recovered it.
</p>
<p>
In five minutes Con came downstairs again, but
without the book.
</p>
<p>
“I seen nawthin’ of the kind,” he said. “But
here’s the envelope of the letter he resaved.”
</p>
<p>
He handed it to Ruth. The address was written
by a hand that certainly was not used to holding
a pen. The scarcely decipherable address was
to “Mist. Nele O. Sorber.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
“Shure the postman skurce knew whether to
bring it here, or no,” Mr. Murphy explained.
</p>
<p>
“I—I would like to take this,” Ruth said slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Shure ye may. I brought it down ter ye,” said
Mr. Murphy, taking up his hammer once more.
</p>
<p>
“But where do you suppose he could have put
that book of ours?” Ruth asked, faintly.
</p>
<p>
“Shure, ma’am, I dunno. Would he be takin’ it
away wid him to read?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but could he?” gasped Ruth. “It was
heavy.”
</p>
<p>
“So was his bag heavy. I knowed by the way
he carried it. And I see it’s few of his clo’es he
took, by the same token, for they are all hangin’
in his closet, save the ones he’s got on.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth’s thoughts fairly terrified her. She got up
and was scarcely able to thank Mr. Murphy. She
had to get out into the air and recover her self-control.
</p>
<p>
Neale! The boy whom they had befriended and
helped and trusted! Under temptation, Neale had
fallen!
</p>
<p>
For Ruth knew well how the ex-circus boy disliked
taking money from his Uncle Bill Sorber,
or being beholden to him in any way. Neale
worked hard—very hard indeed for a boy of his
age—in order to use as little as possible of Mr.
Sorber’s money.
</p>
<p>
Sorber held Neale’s long-lost father in light repute,
and could not understand the boy’s desiring
an education and wishing to be something besides
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
a circus performer. To the mind of the old circus
man it was an honor to be connected with such an
aggregation as Twomley &amp; Sorber’s Herculean
Circus and Menagerie. And Neale’s father had
left the company years before in search of a better
fortune.
</p>
<p>
Ruth’s mind was filled with suspicion regarding
Neale now. Knowing his longing for independence,
why should she not believe that seeing
a chance to obtain a great sum of money with no
effort at all he had fallen before the temptation
and run away with the old album and its wonderful
contents?
</p>
<p>
Ruth knew there was a fortune in that old and
shabby volume which must have lain long in the
garret of the old Corner House. If one of the
notes was good, why not all the others—and the
bonds, too?
</p>
<p>
She opened her purse and withdrew the folded
ten-dollar bill. At the same moment another banknote
fell to the ground—another of the same denomination.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” she said aloud. “That’s the bill Mr.
Howbridge gave me when he went away, saying I
might need something extra.”
</p>
<p>
She picked it up. It was folded exactly like the
other one; but it never entered Ruth’s mind that
she might have handed Mr. Crouch the wrong bill
to examine.
</p>
<p>
Ruth replaced the banknotes in her purse and
walked home with a face still troubled. She could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
take nobody into her confidence—least of all Agnes—regarding
the missing album. It might be, of
course, that Neale O’Neil had only hidden away
the old book until his return. Possibly it was perfectly
safe, and Neale O’Neil might have no more
idea that the money was good than had Agnes.
</p>
<p>
But oh! if Mr. Howbridge were only at home!
That was the burden of Ruth’s troubled thought.
</p>
<p>
She went into the house, her return not being remarked
by the younger children. Upstairs Agnes
was at her dresser putting the finishing touches to
her hair and her frock in readiness for dinner.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” she asked Ruth, as the latter
put down her purse and likewise the torn envelope
Mr. Con Murphy had given her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” ejaculated Ruth. “I must have brought
it away with me.”
</p>
<p>
“Brought what away with you—and from
where?” demanded Agnes, picking up the paper.
Then in a moment she cried: “Why! it’s addressed
to Neale—by his circus name, ‘Neale Sorber.’
Where’d you get it, Ruth?”
</p>
<p>
“I saw Mr. Murphy,” the older sister confessed.
“He thinks that the letter that came in this envelope
was the cause of Neale’s going away so
suddenly.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! it’s some trouble about his uncle,”
said Agnes. “How Neale hates to be called ‘Sorber,’
too!”
</p>
<p>
“That isn’t his uncle’s writing,” Ruth said.
</p>
<p>
“Of course it isn’t,” the second sister replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
scornfully. “Mr. Bill Sorber doesn’t write at all.
Don’t you remember? That’s why he thinks it so
foolish for Neale to want an education. But it’s
somebody Uncle Bill’s got to write for him.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes’ practical explanation could not be gainsaid.
She did not connect for a moment the disappearance
of the old album with Neale’s sudden
flight from Milton. The bonds and banknotes
pasted into the big volume she had found in the
garret gave Agnes not the least anxiety. But she
looked closely at the envelope.
</p>
<p>
“Wish Mr. Murphy had found the letter, too,”
she said. “Then we could have learned what
made that horrid boy run off so.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Tiverton,’ Humph! Where’s Tiverton?
That’s where this letter was mailed. Seems to me
somebody said ‘Tiverton’ to me only lately,” murmured
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Ruth did not hear her, and Agnes said no more
about it. But after she had retired that night and
was almost in dreamland—in that state ’twixt waking
and sleeping when the happenings of the day
pass through one’s mind in seemingly endless procession—suddenly
Agnes sat up in bed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I know where I’ve heard of Tiverton before,”
she whispered shrilly in the darkness.
“That’s where Mr. Howbridge has gone—to see
his sick brother. Say, Ruth!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth was asleep. And by morning Agnes had
forgotten all about the matter. So the coincidence
was not called to the older sister’s attention.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—SOME EXCITEMENT</h2>
<p>
As Uncle Rufus had stated, his daughter, the
pleasant and unctious Petunia Blossom, was to
take a week’s vacation from laundry work at New
Year’s; but she brought the last wash home a few
days after Christmas.
</p>
<p>
Petunia was very, very black, and monstrous
fat! Her father often mournfully wondered “huccome
she so brack,” when he was only mahogany
brown himself and Petunia’s mother had been
“light favahed,” too.
</p>
<p>
“Nevah did see the lak’ ob her color,” declared
Uncle Rufus, shaking his grizzled head. “W’en
she was a baby we couldn’t fin’ her in de dark,
‘ceptin’ her eyes was open, or she was a-bellerin’.”
</p>
<p>
The Corner House girls all liked Petunia Blossom,
and her family of cunning piccaninnies.
There was always a baby, and in naming her
numerous progeny she had secured the help of her
white customers, some of whom were wags, as witness
a portion of the roll-call of the younger Blossoms:
</p>
<p>
“Ya’as’m, Miss Tessie. Alfredia’s home takin’
car’ ob de baby. Burne-Jones W’istler—he de
artis’ lady named—an’ Jackson Montgomery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
Simms, done gone tuh pick up wood, where dey
is buildin’ dat new row ob flats. Gladiola, she’s
jes’ big nuff now tuh mess intuh things. I tol’
Alfredia to keep an eye on Glad.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s a pretty name,” said Agnes, who heard
this; “Gladiola. I hope you’ll find as pretty a
name for the baby.”
</p>
<p>
“I has, Miss Aggie,” Petunia assured her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! but that would be hard. He’s a boy. You
can’t name him after a flower, as you did little
Glad and Hyacinth and Pansy.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, ya-as’m,” Petunia said, with confidence.
“I done hit. De baby, he named aftah a flower,
too. I named him ‘Artuhficial,’ an’ we calls him
‘Arty’ fo’ short.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my dear! ‘Artificial’ flower—of course!”
gasped Agnes, and ran away to have her laugh out.
It certainly pleased the Corner House family.
But Uncle Rufus was critical as usual:
</p>
<p>
“Sho’ don’t see why de good Lawd send all dem
bressed babies t’ dat no-‘count brack woman. He
must know dey ain’t a-gettin’ no fittin’ care. Why—see
yere! She don’t know how even t’ name ’em
propah. Flower names—indeedy, das jes’ mak’
me powerful <em>squeegenny</em>, das does—sho’ nuff!
Ain’t dey no sensible names lef’ in dis worl’, Ah’d
lak’t’ know?”
</p>
<p>
There was nobody able to answer Uncle Rufus’
question, and he went away, grumbling to himself.
And, as he was not within call later, that was why
Dot chanced to go to the drug store for Mrs. MacCall,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
who could not wait for the old colored man’s
return.
</p>
<p>
Tess was upstairs helping Agnes make the beds.
Mrs. MacCall wanted something to use at once and
the smallest Corner House girl was eager to be
helpful.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go! I’ll go, Mrs. MacCall!” she cried,
running for her hood and coat and overshoes, and,
when she had donned them, seizing her Alice-doll,
without which she seldom went anywhere, save to
church and school. “I’ll be there and back in just
<em>no time</em>—you see if I’m not.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. MacCall told her carefully what she wanted,
and gave her the dime.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ll ‘member <em>that!</em>” Dot declared, with assurance,
and she went out repeating it over and
over to herself.
</p>
<p>
It was some distance to the druggist’s and there
were a lot of things to see on the way, and from
frequent repetition of the name of the article the
housekeeper wanted, the smallest Corner House
girl arrived at her destination with only the sound
and not much of the sense of it on her tongue.
</p>
<p>
“Good morning, little Miss Kenway,” said the
druggist, who knew Dot and her sisters very well.
“What can I do for you?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” said Dot, breathlessly. “Mrs. MacCall
wants a box of glory divine.”
</p>
<p>
The druggist gasped, looked all around at his
shelves helplessly, and murmured:
</p>
<p>
“What did you say it was you wanted?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ten cents’ worth of glory divine,” repeated
the smallest Corner House girl, positively.
</p>
<p>
“What—what does she do with it?” asked the
druggist in desperation.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why, she puts it down the sink drain,
and sprinkles it down cellar, an’—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my aunt!” groaned the druggist. “You
mean chloride of lime?”
</p>
<p>
“Ye—yes, sir,” admitted the somewhat abashed
Dot. “I guess that’s mebbe it.”
</p>
<p>
Dot put the article purchased into the go-cart
at Alice’s feet, tucked the rug all around her cherished
child, for it was a cold if sunny day, and
started for home. As she wheeled the doll-carriage
toward the Creamer cottage she saw the laundry
wagon stop at that gate, while the driver
jumped out and ran up the walk to the Creamers’
side porch.
</p>
<p>
Dot knew that Mabel’s mother always had her
basket of soiled clothes ready for the man when he
came and this occasion seemed to be no exception.
There was the basket and the man grabbed it, ran
back to the wagon, and, putting it in at the back,
sprang up to his seat and rattled away to his next
customer.
</p>
<p>
It was after Dot had returned to the old Corner
House and delivered the box of “glory divine” to
the housekeeper that the neighborhood was treated
to a sensation originating in the Creamer cottage.
</p>
<p>
Tess had joined Dot in the yard of the old Corner
House. The weather was much too cold for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
them to have all their dolls in the garden-house as
they did in summer; but Neale had shoveled all
the paths neatly since the last snow-storm, and the
little girls could parade up and down with their
doll carriages to their hearts’ content.
</p>
<p>
They saw Mrs. Creamer run out upon her porch,
look wildly around, and then she began to scream
for Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Mabel! Mabel! come here with the baby this
moment! Didn’t I tell you to let him sleep in the
basket?”
</p>
<p>
Mabel appeared slowly from the back yard.
</p>
<p>
“You naughty child!” cried the worried woman.
“You don’t deserve to have a darling baby brother.
And you broke his carriage, too—I verily believe—so
you wouldn’t have to wheel him in it. Where
is he?”
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t touched him,” declared Mabel, sullenly.
</p>
<p>
“You—what do you mean? Where is the
basket with the baby in it?” demanded Mrs.
Creamer, wildly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” gasped Dot and—as she usually did when
she was startled—she grabbed up her Alice-doll
and hugged her to her bosom.
</p>
<p>
“I—I don’t know,” declared Mabel, looking
rather scared now. “Honest, Mamma—I haven’t
seen him.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s been kidnapped! Thieves! Gypsies!”
</p>
<p>
The poor mother’s shrieks might have been
heard a block. Neighbors came running. Milton
had only a small police force, but one of the officers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
chanced to be within hearing. He came,
heard the exciting tale, and galloped off to the
nearest telephone to let them know at headquarters
that there was a child mysteriously missing.
</p>
<p>
“Why, isn’t that funny?” said Dot to Tess.
“If he was a kidnapper, he looked just like the
laundryman.”
</p>
<p>
“Who did?” demanded the amazed Theresa.
</p>
<p>
“The man who took the basket and stole Bubby
Creamer.”
</p>
<p>
“What ever are you saying, Dot Kenway?”
</p>
<p>
So Dot told her all that she had seen of the
strange transaction.
</p>
<p>
“Why, that was the laundryman, of course!”
declared Tess. “The baby is not stolen at all—at
least he never meant to take it. I know the
laundryman, and he’s got seven children of his
own. I don’t believe he’d steal another.”
</p>
<p>
The whole neighborhood was aroused. Agnes
ran out into the yard to learn what the trouble
was, and Tess and Dot, with great verbosity, related
their version of the occurrence.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, children! we must tell Mrs. Creamer,”
Agnes said. “Of course the laundryman wouldn’t
have stolen the baby! He thought the basket held
the wash and had been put out there for him.”
</p>
<p>
She ran across the yard and swarmed over the
fence into the Creamers’ premises like a boy.
Flying up to the group of lamenting women on the
porch, she exploded her information among them
like a bomb.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
“Telephone to the laundry and find out if the
man has got there yet,” suggested one woman.
</p>
<p>
But Agnes knew that Mrs. Creamer’s was one of
the first places at which the laundryman stopped.
He did not get back to the laundry until near noon.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly an automobile coming up Main Street
attracted the Corner House girl’s attention. She
recognized the driver of the car, and ran out into
the street, calling to him to stop.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Joe Eldred! Wait! Wait!”
</p>
<p>
Joe was a boy somewhat older than Neale
O’Neil, but one of the latter’s closest friends. He
was driving his father’s car, having obtained a
license only the month before.
</p>
<p>
“Joe! Wait!” Agnes repeated, waving her mittened
hand to him.
</p>
<p>
“Hullo! Whose old cat is dead?” was his
reply.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Joe! such a dreadful thing has happened,”
Agnes said breathlessly. “Bubby Creamer has
gone off with Mr. Billy Quirk, the laundryman, and
his mother’s worried to death.”
</p>
<p>
“Whew! that’s some kid!” exclaimed Joe.
“Didn’t know he could walk yet.”
</p>
<p>
“He can’t, silly!” returned Agnes, exasperated.
“Listen!” and she told the boy how the wonder
had occurred. “You know, Mr. Billy Quirk drives
away out High Street to collect laundry. Won’t
you drive out that way and see if he’s got poor
little Bubby in his wagon?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” cried Joe. “Hop in!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
</p>
<p>
“But—but <em>I</em> didn’t think of going.”
</p>
<p>
“Say! You don’t suppose I’d take a live baby
aboard this car all alone?” gasped Joe. “I—guess—not!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ll go!” agreed Agnes, and immediately
slipped into the seat beside him. “Do hurry—do!
Mrs. Creamer is almost crazy.”
</p>
<p>
Joe’s engine had been running all the time, and
in a minute they rounded the corner into High
Street.
</p>
<p>
“Neale got back yet?” asked Joe, slipping the
clutch into high speed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh—oh!” gasped Agnes, as the car shot forward
with suddenly increased swiftness. “How—how
did you know he had gone away?”
</p>
<p>
“Saw him off Christmas morning.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Joe Eldred! did you know Neale was going?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, not till he went,” admitted the boy. “I
was running down to the railroad station to meet
my married sister and her kids—they were coming
over for Christmas dinner—and I saw Neale
lugging his satchel and legging it for the station.
That bag weighed a ton, so I took him in.”
</p>
<p>
“Where did he say he was going?” Agnes asked
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“He didn’t say. Don’t you know?”
</p>
<p>
“If I did I wouldn’t ask you,” snapped Agnes.
“Mean old thing!”
</p>
<p>
“Hul-<em>lo</em>!” ejaculated Joe. “Who’s mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Not you, Joe,” the girl said sweetly. “But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
that Neale O’Neil. He went off without saying a
word to any of us.”
</p>
<p>
“Close mouthed as an oyster, Neale is. But I
asked him what was in the bag, and what d’ you
s’pose he said?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” returned the girl, idly.
</p>
<p>
“He said: ‘Either a hundred thousand dollars
or nothing.’ Now! what do you know about
that?” demanded Joe, chuckling.
</p>
<p>
“What!” gasped Agnes, sitting straight up and
staring at her companion.
</p>
<p>
“I guess if he’d been lugging such a fortune
around it would have been heavy,” added Joe,
with laughter.
</p>
<p>
Agnes was silenced. For once the impulsive
Corner House girl was circumspect. Neale’s answer
to Joe could mean but one thing. Neale
must have carried away with him the old album
she had found in the garret of the Corner House.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness gracious!” thought Agnes, feeling a
queer faintness within. “It can’t be that Neale
O’Neil really believes that money and the bonds
are good! That is too ridiculous! But, if not,
what has he carried the book away with him for?
</p>
<p>
“He was going to show the bonds to somebody,
he said. He went off in too great a hurry to do
that. And did he take the book because the contents
might be valuable and he was afraid to leave
it behind him?”
</p>
<p>
“I never did hear of such a funny mix-up,” concluded
Agnes, still in her own mind. “And Ruth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
acts so strangely about it, too. She looked at the
book first. Can it be possible that she thinks that
old play money is real? Suppose some of it is
good—just <em>some</em> of it?”
</p>
<p>
Agnes had begun to worry herself now about
the old album and its contents. The mystery of
it quite overshadowed in her mind the matter of
the missing baby.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—MISS PEPPERILL’S DISASTER</h2>
<p>
The baby came first, after all, for Joe Eldred
almost immediately exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Say, Aggie! isn’t that Billy Quirk’s wagon
right ahead?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes! Oh, yes, Joe!” Agnes agreed.
“He hasn’t got so far, after all.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you believe he’s got the kid?” demanded
Joe, in doubt. “Look here! The back of the
wagon’s full of clothes baskets. Why! if the kid’s
there, he’s buried!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t!” cried Agnes. “Don’t say such a
thing, Joe!”
</p>
<p>
The boy had slowed down while speaking, and
instantly Agnes was out of the car and had run
ahead.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Quirk! Oh, Mr. Quirk! Billy!” she
shouted. “You’ve got a baby there!”
</p>
<p>
“Heh?” gasped the laundryman, who had been
about to clamber into his seat again. “Got a
baby!” he repeated, in a dazed sort of way, and
actually turning pale. “<em>Not another?</em>”
</p>
<p>
“In your wagon, I mean. It’s Mrs. Creamer’s
Bubby. Oh, dear, Mr. Quirk! do look quick and
see if you’ve smothered him.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean, girl? That I’ve smothered
a baby!” groaned Mr. Quirk, who was a little,
nervous man who could not stand much excitement.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. Do look,” begged Agnes.
“Bubby was in the basket—not the soiled
clothes—”
</p>
<p>
“Which basket?” cried the laundryman.
</p>
<p>
“The one you took away from the Creamers’
porch, Billy,” put in Joe Eldred, who had left the
car, too. “Come on and look. Maybe the kid’s
all right.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! I hope so!” groaned Agnes.
“What would Mrs. Creamer do—”
</p>
<p>
Joe helped the shaking laundryman to lift down
the baskets of wash that were already stacked
three tiers deep in the wagon.
</p>
<p>
“That’s it! That’s the one!” cried Agnes
eagerly, recognizing Mrs. Creamer’s basket.
</p>
<p>
And there was the baby, under a veil, sleeping
as peacefully as could be. Fortunately the basket
placed on top of the baby’s temporary cradle had
been the larger of the two, and had completely and
safely covered the lower basket.
</p>
<p>
They got the baby, basket and all, into the back
of the Eldred car without awakening Bubby, and
Agnes sat beside him.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll drive back as if I had a load of eggs,” Joe
declared, grinning. “If that kid wakes up and
bawls, Aggie, what’ll you do?”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” said Agnes, with scorn, “isn’t that
just like a boy? Don’t you suppose I know how
to take care of a baby?”
</p>

<span class='caption'>And there was the baby, under a veil,<br/>sleeping as peacefully as could be.</span>
</div>
<p>
Bubby did not awake, however, and their return
to the Creamer cottage was like a triumphal entry.
The neighborhood had turned out in a body.
Mrs. Creamer ran a block up the street to meet
the automobile, and she could not thank the Corner
House girl and Joe Eldred enough.
</p>
<p>
But it was told of Mabel Creamer that she stood
on the porch and scowled when they brought
Bubby back in the basket. She actually did say to
Tess and Dot, over the side fence:
</p>
<p>
“An’ they blame me for it. Said I ought to
have been there to watch what Billy Quirk was
goin’ to do. If it had been a really, truly Gypsy
that had kidnapped Bubby, I s’pose they’d shut
me up in jail!”
</p>
<p>
In a few days the little girls were back in school
again, and Mabel was not obliged to stay in to
mind the baby—hated task!—for she was in Dot’s
grade.
</p>
<p>
Tess’ class gathered, too, to welcome Miss Pepperill’s
return to her wonted place—all but
Sammy Pinkney. Sammy was a very sick boy
and they brought straw and put it knee deep in
Willow Street, in front of the Pinkney house, so
as to deaden the sound of wagon wheels. Tess
actually went on tiptoe when she passed the house
where her schoolmate lay so ill.
</p>
<p>
Billy Bumps, the goat, that had once been
Sammy’s, looked longingly through the Corner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
House fence at the straw thus laid down, as though
it was more tempting fodder than that with which
Uncle Rufus supplied him.
</p>
<p>
“I believe Billy Bumps must know Sammy is
awful sick,” Tess said, in a hushed voice to Dot.
“See how solemn he looks.”
</p>
<p>
“Seems to me, Tess,” Dot replied, “I never
saw Billy Bumps look any other way. Why, he
looked solemn when he eat-ed up Mrs. MacCall’s
stocking. I believe he must have a melancholic
disposition.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Melancholic’! Goodness me, Dot!” snapped
Tess, “I wish you wouldn’t try to use words that
you can’t use.”
</p>
<p>
“Why can’t I use ’em, if I want to!” demanded
Dot, stubbornly.
</p>
<p>
“But you get them all wrong.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess I can use ’em if I want to—so now,
Tess Kenway!” exclaimed Dot, pouting. “Words
don’t belong to anybody in particular, and I’ve as
good a right to ’em as you have.”
</p>
<p>
This revolt against her criticism rather staggered
Tess. But she had much more serious
problems to wrestle with at school just then.
</p>
<p>
In the first place Miss Pepperill was very “trying.”
Tess would not admit that the red-haired
teacher was cross.
</p>
<p>
After a vacation of nearly two weeks the pupils
had, of course, gotten quite out of hand. They
were not only uneasy and had forgotten the school
rules, but they seemed to Miss Pepperill to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
particularly dull. Every little thing annoyed the
teacher. She almost lost her voice trying to explain
to the class the differences in tense—for they
took up some simple grammar lessons in that
grade.
</p>
<p>
One day Miss Pepperill completely lost her temper
with Jakey Gerlach, who, in truth, was not her
brightest pupil.
</p>
<p>
“I declare, Jakey, you never will get anywhere
in school. You’re always at the bottom of the
class,” she told him, sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Vell, does idt matter, teacher?” propounded
Jakey, “whether I am at top or at bottom of de
class? You teach de same at bot’ ends.”
</p>
<p>
At the end of each day the teacher was despairing.
Tess always waited, timidly, to walk to the
car with her. There was a crosstown car that
made the trip from school to boarding house fairly
easy for Miss Pepperill.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, had she remained at the hospital with
her sister, where she would have been more or less
under Dr. Forsyth’s eye, the final disaster in Miss
Pepperill’s case would not have arrived.
</p>
<p>
She really lost control of her scholars after a
few days. In her room, where had always been
the greatest decorum because the children feared
her, there was now at times much confusion.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, children!” she gasped, holding her head in
both hands, “I can’t hear myself think!”
</p>
<p>
She sat down, unable to bear the hubbub of class
recitation, and put her hands over her ears for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
moment. Her eyes closed. The throbbing veins
at her temples seemed about to burst.
</p>
<p>
It was Sadie Goronofsky who brought about the
final catastrophe—and that quite innocently. Being
unable at this juncture to attract attention by
the usual means of waving her hand in the air and
snapping her fingers, Sadie jumped up and went
forward to Miss Pepperill’s desk.
</p>
<p>
She had just sent away a class, and their clumsy
footsteps had but ceased thundering on her eardrums
when Sadie came on tiptoe to the platform.
Miss Pepperill did not see her, but Sadie, tired of
weaving her arm back and forth without result,
clutched the edge of the light shawl Miss Pepperill
wore over her shoulders.
</p>
<p>
The jerk the child gave the shawl was sufficient
to pull Miss Pepperill’s elbow from the edge of the
desk where it rested, her hand upholding her
throbbing head.
</p>
<p>
In her weakness the teacher almost pitched out
of her chair to the floor. She shrieked.
</p>
<p>
Sadie Goronofsky flew back to her seat in terror.
Miss Pepperill opened her eyes and saw nobody
near. It was just as though an invisible hand
had pulled at the shawl and had dislodged her
elbow.
</p>
<p>
She was not of a superstitious nature, but her
nerves were unstrung. She uttered another
shriek—then a third.
</p>
<p>
The children under her care were instantly
alarmed. They rose and ran from her, or cowered, whimpering,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
in their seats, while the poor
hysterical woman uttered shriek after shriek.
</p>
<p>
Her cries brought other teachers into the room.
They found her with her hair disarranged, her
dress disheveled, beating her heels on the platform
and shrieking at the top of her voice—quite out
of her mind for the time being.
</p>
<p>
The children were dismissed at once and took
to their homes excited and garbled reports of the
occurrence.
</p>
<p>
Tess did not go home at once. She saw them
finally take Miss Pepperill, now exhausted and
moaning, out to a taxi-cab and drive away with
her to the Women’s and Children’s Hospital,
where Mrs. Eland was.
</p>
<p>
But the damage was done. Poor Miss Pepperill’s
mind was, for the time, quite out of her
control. The next day she had to be removed to
the state hospital for the insane because she disturbed
the other patients under her sister’s care.
</p>
<p>
That ended, of course, Miss Pepperill’s career
as a public school teacher. With a record of having
been at the insane hospital, she could hope
never again to preside over a class of children in
the public school. Her occupation and manner of
livelihood were taken from her.
</p>
<p>
“It is a terrible, terrible thing,” Ruth said at
dinner, the day Miss Pepperill was taken to the
state hospital.
</p>
<p>
Ruth had been with Tess to call on Mrs. Eland,
and the little gray lady had told them all about it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am awfully sorry for my Mrs. Eland, too,”
Tess said. “I am sure she could have cared for
Miss Pepperill if they’d let her stay.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t worry, honey,” Agnes said quickly.
“They’ll soon let Miss Pepperill come back.”
</p>
<p>
“But the harm is done,” Ruth rejoined gravely.
“Just as Dr. Forsyth said, she ought to take a
long, long rest.”
</p>
<p>
“If they were only rich,” sighed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“If <em>we</em> were only rich!” Ruth rejoined.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness! and wouldn’t we be rich—just!—if
all that stage money I found was only real,
Ruthie?” Agnes whispered to her elder sister.
</p>
<p>
Ruth grew very red and said, quite tartly for
her: “I don’t see that it would do us any good—if
it <em>were</em> so. You let it go out of your hands very
easily.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, pshaw! Neale will bring it back,” said
Agnes, half laughing, yet wondering that Ruth
should be so earnest. “You speak just as though
you believed it was good money.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>You</em> don’t know, one way or another, whether
it is so or not.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Ruth!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you don’t, do you?” demanded the elder
sister.
</p>
<p>
“How silly you talk. You’re as bad as Neale
about those old bonds. I believe he lugged that
book off with him just to show somebody the bonds
to see if they were any good.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth turned away, and said nothing more regarding the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
album; but Agnes was more and more
puzzled about the whole affair. The two girls
were not confiding in each other. Nothing, of
course, could have shaken Agnes’ belief in Neale’s
honesty. While, on the other hand, Ruth feared
that the ex-circus-boy had fallen before temptation.
</p>
<p>
Believing, as she did, that the banknotes found
in the album were all good, the oldest Corner
House girl considered that the bonds might be of
great value, too. Altogether, as Neale had figured
up, there was over a hundred thousand dollars in
the album.
</p>
<p>
This fortune was somewhere—so Ruth believed—in
the possession of a thoughtless, if not really
dishonest, boy. A thousand things might happen
to the treasure trove Neale O’Neil had borne away
from the old Corner House.
</p>
<p>
No matter whether it were Neale himself or
another who made wrong use of the money or the
bonds, if they were lost it would be a catastrophe.
Neither the Corner House girls, nor whoever
properly owned the book, would ever be benefitted
by the odd find in the garret of the Stower homestead.
</p>
<p>
Who the actual owner—or owners—of the
treasure was, Ruth could not imagine. But that
she was the proper custodian of the album until
Mr. Howbridge returned, the girl was quite sure.
</p>
<p>
She dared take nobody into her confidence until
their guardian came home. Least of all could she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
talk about it to Agnes. And on her part, Agnes
was quite as loath to speak of the matter, in earnest,
to Ruth.
</p>
<p>
What Joe Eldred had said about Neale and his
heavy satchel really alarmed Agnes. A hundred
thousand dollars! A fortune, indeed.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me!” Agnes thought. “Neale is
never silly enough to believe that the money is
real, is he? Impossible! Yet—why did he carry
the old thing off with him?
</p>
<p>
“It bothers Ruth—I can see that. I don’t know
what idea she’s got in her head; but surely both of
them can’t be mad about that money and those
bonds. Goodness! am I the only sensible one in
the family?” the flyaway asked herself, quite seriously.
</p>
<p>
“For I know very well that stuff in the old album
is nothing but ‘green goods.’ Maybe somebody,
years ago, used it dishonestly—used it to
fool other people. And suppose Neale is fooling
himself with it?”
</p>
<p>
For it never entered the loyal Agnes’ mind that
her boy chum was other than the soul of honesty.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—AGNES IN THE WOODS</h2>
<p>
Perfectly dreadful things were always happening
to Dot Kenway’s Alice-doll. That child certainly
was born under an unlucky star, as Mrs.
MacCall often declared.
</p>
<p>
Yet she was the most cherished of all the smallest
Corner House girl’s large and growing family
of doll-babies. Dot lived with the Alice-doll in a
world of make-believe, and where romance lapped
over the border of reality it was hard for Dot to
tell.
</p>
<p>
The children—Dot and Tess—fed the birds
from the bedroom windows whenever the snow
was on the ground. And Neale, when he was at
hand, hung pieces of fat and suet in the trees for
the jays and shrikes, and other of the “meat-eaters.”
</p>
<p>
The smaller birds were so tame that they hopped
right upon the window-sills to eat. On one sill
Neale had built a rather ingeniously contrived
“sleeping porch” for the Alice-doll, in which Dot
put her—bundled in Uncle Rufus’ napkin-bag—every
night. The screened side served as a ventilator
for the children’s bedroom.
</p>
<p>
The top of this boxlike arrangement was of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
oiled paper, pasted over a wooden frame, and one
eager sparrow, pecking at crumbs on the taut
paper, burst a hole right through; so he, or
another, hopped saucily down through the hole
and tried to peck out the Alice-doll’s bead-like
eyes!
</p>
<p>
“Why—why—you cannibal!” gasped Dot, and
ran to her child’s rescue.
</p>
<p>
With a frightened chirp the sparrow shot up
through the torn paper and winged his flight over
the housetop.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to paste up that hole, Dot,” Tess
said, “or something more than a sparrow will get
in at your Alice-doll.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, me! what <em>shall</em> I do?” moaned Dot.
“Alice must sleep in her porch. The doctors all
say so.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve a piece of silk you may have to paste over
the top of your porch, honey,” Ruth said. “That
will let the light through, and the birds won’t peck
it to shreds.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thank you, sister!” said Dot, much relieved.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll run for the glue bottle,” Tess added, wishing
to be helpful.
</p>
<p>
But having brought the bottle Tess was obliged
to help Agnes with the beds. There were certain
duties the Corner House girls had to do every day,
and on Saturdays three of the early morning hours
at least were spent by all of them save Dot in
housework of one kind or another, and even she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
had some light household duties. The house was
very large and Mrs. MacCall and Linda could not
do all the work. As for Aunt Sarah Maltby, she
only “ridded up” her own room, and never lifted
her fingers to work outside it.
</p>
<p>
So just now Dot was left alone with the silk
and the glue bottle. It was not a difficult task,
and even Dot might be expected to do it with neatness
and despatch.
</p>
<p>
But when Ruth chanced to come into the room
some time later, Dot was still struggling with the
glue bottle. She had not yet been successful in
removing the cork.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me! what a mean, mean thing,” Dot
cried, quite unaware that she was being observed.
“Now I tell you what,” she added, addressing the
cork with which she was struggling, “I’m going
to get you <em>out</em>, if I have to push you <em>in</em>—so there!”
</p>
<p>
This cheered up the family considerably when
it was repeated; but Dot was used to furnishing
amusement for the Corner House family. Usually
the hour spent at the dinner table was the most
enjoyable of all the day for the girls, for all that
had happened during the day was there and then
discussed.
</p>
<p>
It had been just the evening before that Dot was
taken to task quite seriously by Ruth for a piece of
impoliteness of which the little girl stood confessed.
</p>
<p>
“Sister was sorry to see this afternoon, when
you were talking at the gate with Mr. Seneca
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
Sprague, Dot, that you ate cookies out of a paper
bag and did not offer Mr. Sprague any.”
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t,” said Dot. “’Twas crackers.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, crackers, then. You should always offer
any person whom you are with, a share of your
goodies.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Ruthie!” exclaimed Dot. “You know
very well Seneca Sprague wouldn’t have eaten any
of those crackers.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” asked Ruth, still serious.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t he a—a vegetablearian?” propounded
Dot, quite warmly.
</p>
<p>
“A vegetarian—yes,” admitted the older sister.
</p>
<p>
“Well!” exclaimed Dot, in triumph, “he
wouldn’t have eaten ’em then. They were <em>animal</em>
crackers.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes made her preparations that evening for
a visit she proposed to make the next day. After
their work was done on Saturday the Corner
House girls sometimes separated to follow different
paths for the remainder of the holiday. This
week Agnes was going to visit Mr. Bob Buckham
and his invalid wife, who lived some distance from
Milton, but not far off the interurban car line.
</p>
<p>
When she started about ten o’clock to go to the
car, not only Tess and Dot, but Tom Jonah was
ready to accompany her. The old dog was always
glad to be in any expedition; but Agnes did not
want him to follow the car and she told him to go
back.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t do that, sister,” begged Tess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
“We’ll look out for Tom Jonah. You know he’ll
mind us—Dot and me. We’ll bring him home
from the corner.”
</p>
<p>
So he was allowed to pace sedately behind the
trio to the corner of Ralph Avenue where Agnes
purposed to take the car. This was not far down
Main Street from the Parade Ground, and the
children could easily find their way home again.
</p>
<p>
As the three sisters passed the drug store they
saw coming out a woman in long, black garments,
a veil, and a huge collar and a sort of hood of
starched white linen.
</p>
<p>
Dot’s eyes grew big and round as she watched
this figure, and finally she whispered: “Oh, Aggie;
who is that?”
</p>
<p>
“That is a sister of charity,” replied Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Dot pondered deeply for a moment and then returned
to the charge with: “Say, Aggie, which
sister is she—Faith or Hope?”
</p>
<p>
“Hear that child!” sighed Tess. “I never
heard of such a ridiculous question, did you,
Aggie?” she asked the laughing, older sister.
</p>
<p>
Just then the car Agnes must take came along
and the older girl ran to climb aboard, after kissing
the little ones good-bye. And there was Tom
Jonah, bounding right behind her.
</p>
<p>
“No, no! You must not! You can’t, Tom
Jonah,” Agnes cried, stopping at the car step.
“Go back, Tom Jonah!”
</p>
<p>
The dog’s ears and tail drooped. He turned
slowly away, disappointed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
</p>
<p>
“You know I can’t take you in the car,” Agnes
said. “Go home with Tess and Dottie.”
</p>
<p>
She stepped aboard. The conductor just then
rang the bell for starting. Agnes pitched into a
seat as the car jumped forward and failed to see
whether the dog returned to her sisters or not.
</p>
<p>
It was a long ride in rather a round-about way
to the Buckham farm. Mr. Bob Buckham raised
strawberries for market and was a good friend
of the Corner House girls. Agnes particularly
was a favorite of the farmer and his invalid wife.
</p>
<p>
Although the interurban car passed one end of
the Buckham farm, there was another point where
Agnes could leave the car to cut across lots and
through the woods to reach the house. She had
been this way once with Neale, and she thought
it a much pleasanter, if somewhat longer, walk.
</p>
<p>
So, when the car came to the road in the woods
which the Corner House girl was sure was the
right one, she signaled the conductor to stop and
she stepped down into the snow beside the track.
</p>
<p>
Agnes was to learn, however, that the woods look
different under a blanket of snow, from what they
do when the ground is bare.
</p>
<p>
The road into which she ventured was merely
a track leading into a place where cordwood had
been cut. Wagons had gone back and forth, but
not for several days. The path led in a direction
quite different from the Buckham house and every
minute she walked this way took her farther and
farther from the road to Strawberry Farm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
The air was invigorating, the sun shone, and the
path was hard under her feet, so Agnes found the
walk very pleasant indeed. Being quite unconscious
of her mistake, nothing troubled her mind.
She tramped on, rejoicing, expecting to come into
familiar territory within a mile or so.
</p>
<p>
The forest grew thicker as she advanced. The
only tracks she saw in the snow on either side of
the wood road were those of birds and rabbits.
Jays shot through the leafless woods shouting their
raucous call; crows cawed in the distance; close at
hand, squirrels chattered and scolded at her from
the trees as she passed under the stark, bare
branches.
</p>
<p>
Finally the impression was forced upon Agnes
Kenway’s mind that the wood was very lonely.
She heard no axe—and an axe can be heard for
miles. She noticed, too, at length, that the tracks
in the road—both of men and horses—were not
fresh. She had not observed before that a light
snow powdered these marks—and it had not
snowed for three days.
</p>
<p>
“Why! can it be possible that nobody has been
to Mr. Buckham’s by this road for so long?” murmured
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
She turned around to look behind her. As she
did so some creature—quite a big and shaggy
animal—darted across the path and disappeared
in the brush.
</p>
<p>
Mercy! How startled Agnes was for a moment.
It might be a bear! Or a wolf!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
Then, of course, she came to herself, shrugged
her shoulders, and laughed.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a dog. Somebody is out hunting. But
goodness! how he did scare me,” she thought.
</p>
<p>
Agnes went on again, cheerfully enough. The
road was by no means straight. If she looked
back she could see only a short distance, for the
brush and trees hid the back stretches.
</p>
<p>
She turned again. There was the creature just
darting once more into the shrubbery!
</p>
<p>
Agnes halted in her tracks. She was suddenly
smitten with fear. She could not shake the feeling
off. Surely there was something dogging her
footsteps.
</p>
<p>
She puckered her lips to whistle; but no sound
came. She tried to call; but her tongue seemed
dry and her throat contracted. She <em>knew</em> it was
a dog; yet the possibility of its being some savage
beast instead, terrified her.
</p>
<p>
Even a bad dog would be dangerous to meet
in this lonely place. And he followed her so
stealthily!
</p>
<p>
Agnes was panic-stricken at midday. It was
almost noon now, and how strange that she had
not reached the Buckham house! Why! she had
been walking for an hour.
</p>
<p>
It came over the girl suddenly that she was lost.
</p>
<p>
“Yet I don’t see how that can be,” she murmured.
“I’m in the road and it’s plain enough.
Surely it should lead somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless she would have turned about and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
gone back to the car tracks had it not been for the
apparition that seemed dogging her steps.
</p>
<p>
She dared not turn back and face that Unknown!
</p>
<p>
Slily she looked over her shoulder again. There
it was—dim, shaggy, slinking close to the snow.
Agnes was sure now that she knew what it was.
Naught but a wolf would act like that—would trail
her so silently and with such determination.
</p>
<p>
Agnes was truly terror-stricken. She began to
run—and running was not easy in this rutty road.
She fell once; but she did not mind the bruises
and scratches she received, for all she could think
of was that the wolf might leap upon her while
she was down.
</p>
<p>
Up the poor girl scrambled and ran on, crying
now—all her brave temper quenched. She dared
look behind no more. How close her awful pursuer
was she dared not know.
</p>
<p>
On and on she hastened; now running, now
walking fast, her limbs shaking with dread and
weariness. It seemed as though she must come to
some habitation soon. She had had no idea that
there was any such wilderness as this anywhere
back of Milton!
</p>
<p>
There were no signs here of man’s nearness
save the road through the forest, nor had she seen
such since leaving the main highway. As she said,
surely this road must lead somewhere.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Agnes smelled smoke. She saw it rising
between the trees ahead. Escape from the
prowling beast was at hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
The girl hurried on. The place where the smoke
was rising was down a little slope, at the foot of
which she suddenly discovered the railroad. She
knew something about the locality then. It was
some distance from Mr. Bob Buckham’s house.
</p>
<p>
This was a lonely place, too. There was no
station anywhere near. Heaps of ties lay about—cords
and cords of them. It suddenly smote
upon the girl’s mind that tramps might be here.
Tramps followed the railroad line. And tramps
might be more to be feared than a wolf!
</p>
<p>
She halted in her tracks and waited to get her
breath. Of course she glanced fearfully behind
again. But the prowling beast was no longer in
sight. The vicinity of the fire had doubtless made
him hesitate and draw off.
</p>
<p>
So Agnes could take her time about approaching
the campfire. She was sure that was what it
must be. The smoke arose from beyond a great
heap of railroad ties, and now, when her pulses
stopped beating so in her ears, she distinguished
voices.
</p>
<p>
Well! human beings were at hand. She could
not help feeling suspicious of them; yet their nearness
had driven off the strange and terrible beast
that had so frightened her.
</p>
<p>
After a minute or two the Corner House girl
crept forward. Some of her usual courage returned
to her. Her heart beat high and her color
rose. She bit her lower lip with her pretty, even
teeth, as she always did when she labored under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
suppressed excitement, and tiptoed to the end of
the piled up ties.
</p>
<p>
The voices were louder here—more easily distinguished.
There were two of them—a young
voice and an old voice. And in a moment she discovered
something that pleased and relieved her.
The young voice was a girl’s voice—Agnes was
quite positive of that.
</p>
<p>
She thought at once: “No harm can come to me
if there is a girl here. But who can she be, camping
out in the snowy woods?”
</p>
<p>
In another moment she would have stepped
around the corner of the pile of ties and revealed
herself to the strangers had not something that
was said reached her ears—and that something
was bound to arrest Agnes Kenway’s attention.
</p>
<p>
“A book full of money.”
</p>
<p>
The young voice said this, and then the other
spoke, it seemed, doubtingly.
</p>
<p>
Again came the girl’s voice with passionate
earnestness:
</p>
<p>
“I tell you I saw it! I know ’twas money.”
</p>
<p>
“It don’t sound reasonable,” and the man’s
husky voice was plainer now.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you I saw it. I had the book in my
hand.”
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you bring it away and let me see
it?” demanded the other.
</p>
<p>
“I’d ha’ done it, Pop, if I’d been let. He had
it in his bag in his room. I got in and had the
book in my hand. It’s heavy and big, I tell you!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
He came in and caught me messin’ with his things,
and I thought he’d lam me! You know, Neale always
was high tempered,” added the strange
young voice.
</p>
<p>
Agnes was powerless to move. Mention of
money in a book was sufficient to hold her in her
tracks. But now they were speaking of Neale
O’Neil!
</p>
<p>
“Where’d he ever get so much money?” demanded
the husky voice.
</p>
<p>
“Stole it, mebbe.”
</p>
<p>
“None of the Sorbers was ever light-fingered—you’ve
got to say that much for them.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that boy doing with all that money,
and we so poor?” snarled the young voice,
“Wasn’t you hurt when that gasoline tank exploded
in the big top, just the same as Bill Sorber?
And nobody made any fuss over you.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, well, well,” muttered the man.
</p>
<p>
“They’re not carin’ what becomes of us—neither
Twomley nor Sorber. Here you’ve been
laid up, and it’s mid-winter and too late for us to
get any job till the tent shows open in the spring.
An’ we must beat it South like hoboes. I say
’tisn’t fair!” and the young voice was desperate.
</p>
<p>
“There ain’t many things fair in this world,
Barnabetta,” said the husky voice, despondently.
</p>
<p>
“I—I’d steal that money from Neale Sorber if
I got the chance. And he’ll be coming back to this
very next town with it. That’s where he’s living
now—at Milton. I hate all the Sorbers.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
“There, there, Barnabetta! Don’t take on so.
We’d have got into some good act in vaudeville
’fore now if I hadn’t had to favor my ankle.”
</p>
<p>
“You’d better’ve let me go into that show alone,
Pop.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no, my girl. You’re too young for that.
No, that warn’t the right kind of a show.”
</p>
<p>
The girl’s voice sounded wistful now: “Wish
we could get an act like that we had in the tent
show when Neale was with us. He was a good
kid then.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but there ain’t many like Neale Sorber
was. And like enough he’s gone stale ‘fore now.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d just like to know where he got all that
money,” said the girl-voice. “And in a book, too.
I thought ’twas a photograph album.”
</p>
<p>
“Hist!” said the man-voice, “’Tisn’t so much
where he got it as it is, is he comin’ back here
with it.”
</p>
<p>
“He’ll come back to Milton, sure. Bill Sorber
isn’t so sick now.”
</p>
<p>
The voices died to a whisper. Agnes, both
troubled and frightened, tried to steal away. But
she had been resting her weight upon the corner
of the heap of ties. As she moved, the icy timbers
shook, slid, and suddenly overturned.
</p>
<p>
Agnes, her face white, and with a terrified air,
found herself facing a man and, not a girl but, a
boy, who had sprung up from a log by the fire.
And they knew she had overheard their conversation.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—BARNABETTA</h2>
<p>
“Why, there isn’t any girl here at all!” Agnes
Kenway exclaimed, as she faced the two people
who had been sitting by the bonfire.
</p>
<p>
They were shabby people and both had bundles
tied to the end of stout staves. Evidently they
had either walked far, or had stolen a ride upon a
freight train to this spot. There was a water-tank
in sight.
</p>
<p>
The boy, who was thin, and tall, and wiry looking,
slipped the bundle off his stick, and seizing
the stick itself as a club, advanced stealthily
around one side of the fire. The man seemed to
be a much more indecisive sort of creature. His
smooth face was like parchment; his ears stood
out like bats’ wings. No one could honestly call
him good looking. Rather was he weak looking;
and his expression was one of melancholy.
</p>
<p>
Somehow, Agnes was not much afraid of the
man. It was the boy who made her tremble. He
looked so wild, and his eyes blazed so as he
clutched the stick, creeping nearer to Agnes all the
time.
</p>
<p>
As he advanced, Agnes began to retreat, stepping
slowly backward. She would have run at
once, trusting to her lightness of foot to relieve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
her of the boy’s company in a few rods, had it not
been that she remembered the unknown and savage
beast that had followed her to this spot.
</p>
<p>
It must have been this boy’s voice she had
heard; yet it sounded just like a girl’s. Agnes was
greatly puzzled by the youth’s appearance. She
looked again over his supple, crouching body
as he advanced. It was wide-hipped, narrow-waisted,
and not at all boyish looking. Despite
the thinness of this young stroller, his figure did
not at all suggest the angles of a boy’s frame.
</p>
<p>
Aside from being puzzled, Agnes Kenway was
much afraid of him. His face was so keenly
threatening in expression, and his stealthy actions
so antagonistic, that the Corner House girl almost
screamed aloud. Finally, she found relief in
speech.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do with that stick?
Put it down!” she cried.
</p>
<p>
“I—I——You’ve been listening to us talking,”
said the boy. But it was the girl’s voice that
spoke.
</p>
<p>
It did not sound like a boy’s voice at all. It
was too high, and there was a certain sweetness
to it despite the tremor of the notes. Agnes began
to recover her self-possession. She might
have been afraid of a reckless boy. But she was
strong herself, and agile. Even if the other did
have a stick—
</p>
<p>
“You were listening,” cried the other accusingly,
again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
“Yes, I was listening—a little,” confessed the
Corner House girl. “But so would you—”
</p>
<p>
“No, I wouldn’t. That’s sneaky,” snapped the
other.
</p>
<p>
“How about your finding out about the book
of money you spoke of?” asked Agnes, boldly.
“Didn’t you do anything ‘sneaky’ to find out
about <em>that</em>?”
</p>
<p>
The other started and dropped the stick. The
man sat down suddenly. It was plain, even to
usually unobservant Agnes Kenway, that her remark
had startled both of them.
</p>
<p>
“I was alone—and lost,” Agnes went on to explain.
“I was trying to reach Mr. Bob Buckham’s
farm, and a wolf chased me—”
</p>
<p>
“A wolf!” interrupted the youthful tramp.
“Now I know you’re telling a wicked story.”
</p>
<p>
“It was. Or something,” said Agnes, stoutly.
“I was scared. Then I saw your smoke.”
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you walk right in and speak to us
instead of snoopin’?”
</p>
<p>
“You’d have ‘snooped’,” flashed back Agnes,
with some heat. “I was alone, and I was afraid
of tramps—”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’re tramps,” said the boy, stooping
and picking up the dropped stick.
</p>
<p>
“Not the kind I am afraid of,” Agnes replied,
trying to smile.
</p>
<p>
The boy would not be pacified, but the man said,
shakingly, from his seat on the log:
</p>
<p>
“We wouldn’t hurt you, girl. Put down that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
stick, Barney. This is my son, Barney, and I’m
Asa Scruggs. I’m a joey when I’m in luck, and
Barney—he’s a trapeze artist. He’s good.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Pop!” shrilled the youthful trapeze artist,
“might’s well tell the truth this time. She’s
nothing but a girl herself.”
</p>
<p>
“And that’s what you are!” cried Agnes, with
excitement.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I’m Barnabetta, not Barney, Scruggs.
Nice name, isn’t it?” scoffed the strange girl.
“My mother was Pennsylvania Dutch; that’s
where I got my name, Barnabetta. But it’s safer
to travel as a boy, so I’m Barney on the road.
Besides, skirts would be in the way, climbing in
and out of ‘rattlers.’”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what fun!” gasped Agnes. “Do you and
your father always travel this way?”
</p>
<p>
“You bet we don’t! Not when we have an engagement.
We’ve ridden in Pullman cars—haven’t
we, Pop?”
</p>
<p>
The man nodded. He did not say much but
watched Agnes with eyes that, in a child, the girl
would have thought expressed terror. Barnabetta
was much the stronger character of the two,
the Corner House girl was positive.
</p>
<p>
“But where are you traveling now?” asked
the interested Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“We’re aimin’ on gettin’ South, miss. There’s
tent shows there all winter long,” said the man,
plaintively. “I’ve been laid up with my ankle,
and it’s too late to get any bookings worth while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
through the usual vaudeville agencies. We been
workin’ for Twomley &amp; Sorber’s Herculean Circus
and Menagerie; but of course they’re in
winter quarters now at Tiverton. That’s where
I got hurt—right at the end of the season,
too.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes’ brain was working busily. Twomley &amp;
Sorber’s at Tiverton. Tiverton was where the
letter was postmarked that had taken Neale O’Neil
away from home so strangely. The talk she had
just overheard assured her that these two circus
performers had been conversing about Neale and
the old album full of money and bonds that he had
taken away with him.
</p>
<p>
But she caught the disguised Barnabetta watching
her very sharply. That girl’s black eyes were
like glittering steel points. They seemed to say:
“How much does this girl who listened guess—how
much does she suspect—how much does she
know?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to work up some kind of patter to
go with our act if we strike a job,” said Barnabetta,
still with her eyes fixed on the Corner House
girl. “You’ve got to have something new if you
expect to put any act over these days. Pop’s a
good joey—”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you mean a clown?” asked Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Yep. How’d you know?” sharply retorted
Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“I—I’ve heard the word used before,” admitted
Agnes, seeing that she had been unwise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
“Then you know circus folks?” observed the
suspicious trapeze artist.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no!”
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta was not convinced, that was plain.
But she turned in a matter-of-fact way to the man.
“Well, Pop,” she said coolly, “about that
money.” The man jumped, and his weak eyes
opened wide. But Barnabetta kept right on and
Agnes was sure she was winking at her father.
“You must disbelieve me when I say I saw it, and
I’m goin’ to say we’ll get it,” she declared.
</p>
<p>
“Huh?” gasped the clown.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the way it must be in our act,” the girl
said firmly. “In our act—don’t you see?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Ha! Hum!” said the clown, clearing his
throat. “I see.”
</p>
<p>
“This is second-story work,” the girl explained
eagerly. “I’ll show you how to climb up to the
window for the money—that’s to the trapeze, you
see,” she added, throwing the explanation at
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I see,” murmured the Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
“And you play the joey part, Pop,” pursued
Barnabetta. “I’ll go ahead, and say ‘Hist!’ and
‘Take care!’ and ‘Clumsy!’ and the like, making
believe we’re going to rob a house. You do the
joey, as I said, and climb almost up to the trapeze
on the rope, and then make a fall. We’ve got to
get the laughs,” she added again, glancing sidewise
at Agnes.
</p>
<p>
The latter felt very peculiar indeed. Bluntly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
honest, it was hard for Agnes to play a part in this
way. She knew the girl trapeze performer was
trying to lead her astray. Barnabetta and her
father were talking of Neale and his money before
Agnes appeared, and this tale about the new act
was being invented on the spur of the moment to
confuse her.
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta stopped suddenly. Perhaps she saw
that her tale was making little impression upon
their visitor.
</p>
<p>
“Where were you going, miss?” asked Mr.
Scruggs, after a minute’s silence.
</p>
<p>
“I was on my way to visit Mr. and Mrs. Buckham.
They expect me,” said Agnes, wisely.
“But I must have missed the road. I know where
I am now, however, I’ll go down the railroad beyond
the water-tank a little way and find the very
crossing of the lane that goes into their dooryard
from the west. Those trees must hide the house
from here.”
</p>
<p>
Secretly Agnes wanted to get away, but not to
visit Mr. and Mrs. Buckham. She felt that she
ought to communicate with Neale O’Neil just as
soon as possible. This old clown and his disguised
daughter might have a plan to stop Neale
on his way home and take the old album and its
precious contents away from him.
</p>
<p>
For now Agnes, like her sister, Ruth, had begun
to believe that the engraved slips of paper pasted
into the book were “really truly” banknotes.
How they had gotten there, and who they originally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
belonged to, Agnes could not guess. Nor did
she believe that Neale O’Neil had carried them off
with him, knowing them to be good currency.
</p>
<p>
However, everybody who got a sight of them
seemed to think that the notes were legal tender.
Even this strange girl, Barnabetta Scruggs,
thought Neale was carrying around thousands of
dollars with him. Dear me! if Neale would only
know enough to go to Mr. Howbridge, there at his
brother’s house at Tiverton, the lawyer would tell
him just what to do with the old album.
</p>
<p>
These thoughts raced like lightning through
Agnes’ mind as she turned calmly away from the
campfire. “I must be going,” she said. “Good-bye.”
</p>
<p>
The man said nothing, but looked away. Barnabetta
said: “How about that wolf you said was
chasing you?” and she said it sneeringly, as
though she doubted Agnes’ story.
</p>
<p>
“I guess he won’t follow me down upon the railroad
tracks,” the Corner House girl said cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
“Huh! I guess he won’t. ’Cause why? There
wasn’t any wolf,” snapped Barnabetta. “That’s
a story!”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t, either!” cried Agnes, hotly.
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know what you were hidin’ behind
that pile of ties and listenin’ to us for?” said the
circus girl.
</p>
<p>
“I told you how I came to do that.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe you,” was the flat reply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
Agnes was too impulsive to let this stand without
answering. She whirled and spoke hotly to
the trapeze performer:
</p>
<p>
“I tell you the truth. I doubt if you tell me
the truth. Why were you so afraid of being overheard,
if all that talk about the money you saw in
the book was just play-acting?”
</p>
<p>
“You are too smart,” snarled Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“I am smart enough to know that you are trying
to fool me. I’m not going to believe you at
all—not a word you say. I don’t like you. I’m
going to Mr. Buckham’s—so now!”
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta sprang forward, crying: “You’re
not goin’ so fast! Is she, Pop?”
</p>
<p>
Agnes had forgotten the clown. He had come
silently around the other side of the fire—evidently
at some signal from Barnabetta—and was
now right at her elbow.
</p>
<p>
“Grab her, Pop! Don’t let her get away!”
cried the circus girl, commandingly.
</p>
<p>
Agnes would have run; but she fairly bumped
into the little man. He seized her by both arms,
and she found that she was powerless against him.
</p>
<p>
At this point Agnes Kenway became thoroughly
frightened. She opened her lips and screamed
for help.
</p>
<p>
Instantly there was a scrambling in the brush
beside the overturned pile of ties, a savage growl,
and a shaggy body sprang into sight and charged
the struggling Corner House girl and the man
who held her.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—AGNES SHOULDERS RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
<p>
“Tom Jonah!” screamed Agnes; for in this
emergency she recognized the old dog.
</p>
<p>
He had followed the car from town, had scented
out her tracks when she entered the woods, and so
had followed Agnes to this spot, afraid to come up
with her for fear of being scolded; for, of course,
he knew well enough he had disobeyed.
</p>
<p>
But now the dog’s loyalty to one of his little
mistresses had brought Tom Jonah out of hiding.
The attempt of Asa Scruggs to hold Agnes was an
unfortunate move on the clown’s part.
</p>
<p>
Tom Jonah shot out of the bushes, growling
fiercely, and charged the man. Scruggs let go of
Agnes and shrank back, trying to flee—for the dog
looked quite as savage as the wolf Agnes had
thought was following her.
</p>
<p>
As he turned, Scruggs slipped and went down.
His right foot twisted under him and the dog’s
heavy body flung him flat on his back. Tom Jonah
held the clown down with both forepaws on his
chest and a threatening muzzle at his throat.
</p>
<p>
Agnes could easily have gotten away now. The
clown could not move, and Barnabetta began to
cry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Pop! Oh, Pop!” she wailed. “He’s going
to eat you up!”
</p>
<p>
Agnes knew Tom Jonah would not let the man
rise unless she commanded him to do so. So she
did not leave the spot as she had at first intended.
All in an instant, through the interference of the
old dog, the tables had been turned.
</p>
<p>
“If I call him off,” she asked, shakingly, of
Barnabetta, “will you leave me alone?”
</p>
<p>
“You’ve fixed Pop with your nasty old dog—hasn’t
she, Pop? That’s his bad ankle. He can’t
do anything to you now,” declared the trapeze
performer.
</p>
<p>
“And you let that stick alone,” commanded
Agnes. “Tom Jonah will do anything I tell him
to,” she added, warningly, and then proved it by
calling the old dog to come to her. He came,
growling, and showing the red of his eyes as he
looked over his shoulder at the prostrate clown.
The man seemed unable to rise, but sat up, groaning,
and rubbing the twisted ankle.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, me!” cried Barnabetta; “that fixes
us for another two months. You won’t be able
to work at all, Pop, even if we get a job. What
ever shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
Agnes began to feel most unhappy. Her excitement
once past, she felt that she was somehow
partly to blame for the clown’s predicament.
And she could not help feeling sorry for him and
for this strange girl who was dressed in boy’s
apparel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
</p>
<p>
Besides, Agnes felt a sort of admiration for
Barnabetta Scruggs. There was romance attached
to her. A girl, not much older than Agnes
herself, tramping in boy’s clothing and meeting
all sorts of adventures on the road! Agnes failed
to remember that right then Barnabetta and her
father were meeting with one very unpleasant
adventure.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me,” said the Corner House girl, with
sympathy. “Is he really hurt?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s his sprained ankle hurt again. It’s
even worse than just an ordinary sprain,” explained
the trapeze performer. “He can’t do any
stunts, or joey work on crutches, can he? The
doctor told him to be careful for a long time with
it. What <em>shall</em> we do?”
</p>
<p>
“He—he won’t be able to walk, will he?” gasped
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Only on a crutch. We can’t do any travelin’
on railroads with him this way. And he can’t
walk. How far’s it to Milton?”
</p>
<p>
“You can get an electric car to town if you follow
this woodpath.”
</p>
<p>
“How far?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been almost an hour and a half walking
here from the car.”
</p>
<p>
“Must be four or five miles then,” murmured
Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Never can hobble that far—can you, Pop?”
asked the circus girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not yet,” groaned the man. He was taking
off his shoe and sock. “Get me some snow,
Barnabetta,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“My, that’s so!” she exclaimed. “We can pack
it in snow to take down the swellin’.”
</p>
<p>
“He’ll get his foot frostbitten sitting here without
any shoe on,” said Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll keep a good fire goin’,” said the girl,
shortly.
</p>
<p>
“And stay here all night—in the open?” cried
Agnes, horror-stricken at such a thought.
</p>
<p>
“Where else?” snapped Barnabetta. “There’s
no place to go. We’ve got no friends, anyway.
And we’ve mighty little money. We expected to
steal a ride South, and sleep in farmers’ barns,
and the like. We’ve done it before. But we’ve
never been so bad off as <em>this</em>.”
</p>
<p>
She said all this too low for her father to hear.
She added: “Pop always had his health and
strength before.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” groaned Agnes, impulsively.
“I wish Neale were here.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” ejaculated the circus girl, sharply.
“What Neale’s that?”
</p>
<p>
Agnes remained silent, sorry that she had
spoken so thoughtlessly.
</p>
<p>
“I might have known you were one of those
girls,” added Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“What girls?” asked Agnes, curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Those that Neale O’Neil lives with at Milton.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
“He doesn’t live with us. He lives next door
to us—with Mr. Con Murphy.”
</p>
<p>
“Bill Sorber said he lived with some Corner
House girls. That’s what he called you,” said
Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“Just the same,” said Agnes, boldly; “I wish
he were here. He’d know what to do—how to
help you.”
</p>
<p>
But Barnabetta was despondent. “Nobody
can’t help us,” she said. “We’re in bad.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I <em>will</em> find some way of helping,” declared
Agnes, trying to speak comfortingly.
</p>
<p>
“Huh! lots of good you can do now,” grumbled
the other. “You and that nasty dog has just fixed
Pop.”
</p>
<p>
“It wasn’t Tom Jonah’s fault. And I’m sure
it wasn’t my fault. He was only defending me.
You and your father shouldn’t have tried to stop
me.”
</p>
<p>
“You hid the dog in the bushes a-purpose,”
cried Barnabetta, angrily. “You know you did.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I didn’t. And he scared me enough, too.
I thought he was a wolf,” said Agnes, anxious to
explain though why she should be put on the
defensive, it would be difficult to tell.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” concluded Barnabetta, roughly, “you
can’t be any good here.”
</p>
<p>
“I know I can’t. But I believe I can help you
just the same.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t want your help,” growled the circus
girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! don’t say that,” begged the Corner House
girl. “I can go to Mr. Bob Buckham and get his
carriage and horses—”
</p>
<p>
“We haven’t got any money to pay for a carriage,”
said Barnabetta, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“You won’t have to pay Mr. Buckham for doing
an act of Christian charity,” declared Agnes, and
she set off immediately, Tom Jonah following
closely at her heels.
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta did not even bid her good-bye. She
was all solicitude for her father’s hurt ankle,
and was now kneeling by him, packing the snow
about the swelling foot. But she was “as hard as
nails” toward the Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
Agnes hurried right down to the railroad and
walked without molestation to the crossing she
had spoken of. There, up the snowy lane, she obtained
her first glimpse of Mr. Bob Buckham’s
house.
</p>
<p>
She had come a roundabout way to it, indeed.
It was now long past noon and she had missed her
dinner. Of course, Mr. and Mrs. Buckham had
ceased expecting her long ago.
</p>
<p>
The big girl who worked in Mrs. Buckham’s
kitchen—Posey by name and an autocrat to a degree—met
Agnes with a cheerful greeting, but refused
admission to Tom Jonah.
</p>
<p>
“No. He can’t come in. I just been scrubbin’
my floor and I can’t ‘low no dog trackin’ it up.
You drop your arctics there on the porch, Miss
Aggie, and then you can run in to Mrs. Buckham.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
</p>
<p>
“If Tom Jonah only wore arctics!” sighed the
Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
“Well, he don’t—more’s the pity,” agreed
Posey.
</p>
<p>
Agnes ran into the invalid’s room, all breathless,
but full of her adventure. There sat Mrs.
Buckham in her wheel-chair, surrounded by bright
worsteds and fancywork, as busy and smiling as
though she had not spent twenty years between
that chair and her bed.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s our Corner House girl at last. And
why not to dinner?” cried Mrs. Buckham.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mercy me! I didn’t even re-<em>mem</em>-ber dinner
till just this minute!” Agnes confessed.
</p>
<p>
“Your poor child! No dinner? Quick, Posey!
here’s a starving child—”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Dear</em> Mrs. Buckham—wait! Never mind me.
I sha’n’t starve yet,” declared the plump Agnes,
laughing. “Look at me. Do I seem so frail?
And I’ve had the greatest adventure!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, well!”
</p>
<p>
“Where is Mr. Buckham? I must tell him all
about it, too,” Agnes said, excitedly.
</p>
<p>
And here came the farmer as she spoke—bewhiskered,
grizzled, keen-eyed and always smiling,
who cried:
</p>
<p>
“Here’s the tardy one! Why, I thought you
were coming out betimes, young lady? How are
all at the Corner House?”
</p>
<p>
Agnes was too greatly excited to reply in full to
that question. Mr. Bob Buckham sat down and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
Corner House girl related all that had befallen her
since she had left home that morning—save that
she said nothing about the mystery of the big album
she had found in the Corner House garret, and
the Scruggs’ interest in its contents.
</p>
<p>
Her explanation, therefore, as to why the circus
clown and his daughter desired to detain her at
their camp in the woods was rather hazy; but the
fact of the clown being hurt and the helplessness
of the two trampers were sufficient to excite the
pity and alarm of the farmer and his wife.
</p>
<p>
“Tut! tut!” clucked Mr. Buckham. “They
can’t stay out there in the snow. It’s going to be
mighty cold to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“It is awful to think of,” agreed Mrs. Buckham.
“But Posey’s got her hands full. If I was up
and about myself—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, Mrs. Buckham! I wasn’t thinking of
such a thing as bringing them here,” Agnes cried.
“The man can’t walk to the Milton car. He can
scarcely walk at <em>all</em>, with that sprained ankle.
But if Mr. Buckham will hitch up and drive over
there, and take ’em to the car, I can get ’em from
the car to the Corner House.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me, child! To your house?” cried
Mrs. Buckham.
</p>
<p>
“Dunno ’bout that,” said Mr. Buckham.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said Agnes. “We’ve plenty of
room—and beds enough for a hotel.”
</p>
<p>
“But what will Ruth say?” asked the farmer’s
wife.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
</p>
<p>
“And what will your Mrs. MacCall say, eh?”
chuckled the farmer.
</p>
<p>
“Why, don’t you suppose they will be kind to
’em, too?” cried Agnes. “Ruth would do the
same herself. I know these poor folk have very
little money and nowhere to go—”
</p>
<p>
“Enough said, Robert. We have no right to
thwart such unselfish impulses,” Mrs. Buckham
said. “Go and harness up the carriage—”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said the farmer, “I’ll take the pung.
And I’ll fill the body with straw, so ‘t that poor
chap won’t get his ankle hurt no more. How’s
the streets in town, Aggie? How’s High Street?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s good sledding,” declared the girl.
“We see nothing now but automobiles and
sleighs.”
</p>
<p>
“Strawberry Farm ain’t got quite as fur as an
auto yet,” chuckled Mr. Buckham. “But maybe
we will in time,” and he went out to hitch up.
</p>
<p>
Without having been told further, Posey now
brought in a cup of hot cocoa and a nice little
luncheon. In the midst of eating this welcome
feast, Agnes remembered the forlorn party
camping amid the railroad ties.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! I don’t suppose Mr. Scruggs
and Barnabetta have anything at all to eat—poor
things!” she cried.
</p>
<p>
So a big basket was filled with food and a can of
coffee, and that Agnes carried out to the sleigh
when it appeared at the side porch, and climbed
into the great heap of straw with it, and burrowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
down. The colts started off briskly, and they left
Posey on the porch watching them while Mrs.
Buckham waved her hand at the window.
</p>
<p>
The farmer knew how to drive right to the spot
where the Scruggs were encamped, although it
was not on his land. When the colts came through
the woods, their bells jingling and the snow and
ice flying from their sharpened hoofs, Barnabetta
appeared suddenly on the pile of ties to see who
came.
</p>
<p>
“Is that the gal?” asked Farmer Buckham of
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“She’s a wild lookin’ critter, ain’t she?” was
Mr. Buckham’s comment. “And looks for all the
world like a boy!”
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta disappeared in a moment and when
he drew the colts in beside the fire, there she stood
with her staff, as though to defend the old clown
from the newcomers.
</p>
<p>
“So you’re back again, are you?” was her greeting
for Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t I tell you I’d bring help?” shouted the
Corner House girl, gaily.
</p>
<p>
“Humph! I don’t see what help you can be
for the like of us,” said the trapeze performer
ungraciously.
</p>
<p>
But Agnes Kenway was not to be balked in her
good intentions. “Of course we can help you.
I’ve come to take you home,” she declared.
“And here’s some lunch.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
</p>
<p>
“What d’you mean—<em>home?</em> We haven’t got a
home, Pop and me.”
</p>
<p>
“But I have,” Agnes said.
</p>
<p>
“That’s nothin’ to do with us,” grumbled Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
She looked very sullen and unhappy. The
clown was crouching close to the fire, but had
drawn his shoe and stocking on again. He looked
very miserable, and warm-hearted Agnes determined
not to allow herself to become angry with
Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Barnabetta,” she said coaxingly, “don’t
be cross. I want to be friends with you.”
</p>
<p>
“What for?” demanded the other girl, sharply.
</p>
<p>
“I want to take you to my house,” pursued
Agnes, without answering the last question.
“The Corner House, you know. We’ve plenty of
room and I know my sister, Ruth, will be kind to
you.”
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta and her father looked at each other
now in stunned surprise. Why Agnes should
really want to help them they could not understand.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Buckham is kind enough to take us all in
his sleigh,” pursued Agnes, after calling to Tom
Jonah to stay on the other side of the sleigh,
for Barnabetta was a little afraid of the big dog.
“We’ll be in Milton in two hours and there your
father can be made comfortable.”
</p>
<p>
“Say! this isn’t a trick?” ejaculated the trapeze
performer at last.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p>
“What kind of trick?” asked Agnes, in wonder.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Barnabetta, doubtfully, “you
might make us trouble. We’re sort of vagrants.
Once, when we were travelin’, Pop and me, we got
pulled by a fresh constable, and I was afraid
they’d find out I wasn’t a boy.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” gasped Agnes, for the romance of
Barnabetta’s situation appealed strongly to the
Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
“You’re not thinkin’ of handin’ us over to the
police, are you?” added Barnabetta, shrewdly.
</p>
<p>
“Great goodness, girl!” gasped Mr. Buckham,
“it must ha’ been your fortune to meet mighty
mean folks in your short life.”
</p>
<p>
“Yep, it has,” said the circus girl, drily.
“We’ve got plenty good friends in the business.
Circus folks are nice folks. Only we got on the
outs with the Sorbers. But outside—well, there’s
plenty folks down on them that have to tramp it.
And we’ve had our experiences,” concluded Barnabetta,
nodding her head and pursing her lips.
</p>
<p>
“Well, these Corner House girls ain’t no bad
kind,” said the farmer, earnestly. “If you need
help, you’ve come to the right shop for it.”
</p>
<p>
“I never asked her for help!” flared up the circus
girl.
</p>
<p>
“You need help just the same,” answered Mr.
Buckham. “And you’d better take it when it’s
kindly offered. You know your father ain’t in no
shape to camp out this weather. And it’s getting
colder.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Barnabetta, ungraciously enough.
“What do you say, Pop?”
</p>
<p>
Poor Scruggs was evidently used to “playing
second fiddle,” as Mr. Buckham would have himself
expressed it. He just nodded, and said:
</p>
<p>
“I leave it to you, Barney. We’ll do just like
you say.”
</p>
<p>
The circus girl poised herself on one foot and
looked doubtful. Her father did not stir.
</p>
<p>
“You know,” said Agnes, “Neale maybe will
be home soon. He’ll know how to help you,” she
added, with confidence in her boy chum’s wisdom.
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta’s black eyes suddenly flashed.
“All right,” she said, grumpily enough, and
turned away to help her father rise.
</p>
<p>
Agnes’ heart was suddenly all of a flutter. She
could not help wondering if Barnabetta was thinking
of the money in the old album that Neale
O’Neil was carrying about the country with him.
Yet that seemed an ungenerous thought and Agnes
put it behind her. Later it was to return in spite
of her—and with force.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—SEVERAL ARRIVALS</h2>
<p>
Perhaps no girl but a Corner House girl would
have planned to take two perfect strangers home
with her, especially strangers who seemed of a
somewhat doubtful character.
</p>
<p>
It must be confessed that the Corner House
girls, with no mother or father to confide in or advise
with, sometimes did things on the spur of
impulse that ordinary girls would not think of
doing.
</p>
<p>
Agnes Kenway really had serious doubts about
the honesty of Barnabetta Scruggs and her father.
Just the same she was deeply interested in the
circus girl, and she pitied the meek little clown.
Barnabetta was quite the most interesting girl
Agnes had ever met.
</p>
<p>
To think of a girl traveling about the country—“tramping
it”—dressed as a boy, and so successfully
hiding her identity! Why! if she did
not speak, nobody would guess her sex, Agnes was
sure.
</p>
<p>
What lots of adventures she must have had!
How free and untrammeled her life on the road
must be! Agnes herself had often longed for the
freedom of trousers. She was jealous of Neale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
O’Neil because he could do things, and enjoy fun
that she could not partake of because of the skirts
she wore.
</p>
<p>
And it was nothing new for the next to the oldest
Corner House girl to fall desperately in love
with a strange girl at first sight. Neale said,
scornfully, that she was forever getting “new
spoons.” He added that she “had a crush” on
some girl almost always; but she seldom kept one
of these loves longer than one term of school—sometimes
not so long.
</p>
<p>
Her “very dearest friend” was not always
chosen wisely; but while that one was in vogue,
Agnes was as loyal to her as ever Damon was to
Pythias. And it must be admitted that it was
usually by no fault of Agnes’ that these friendships
were broken off.
</p>
<p>
For more than one reason did Agnes Kenway
contract this sudden and violent fancy for Barnabetta
Scruggs.
</p>
<p>
Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Buckham had raised any
objection to Agnes’ taking the two strolling people
home to the old Corner House, because of two
very good reasons. First, they were very simple
minded people themselves and it was their rule
to do any kindness in their power; and secondly,
Agnes had told them nothing at all about the conversation
she had overheard between Barnabetta
and her father regarding the book filled with
money that Neale O’Neil had carried to Tiverton
with him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
</p>
<p>
Agnes helped get the poor circus clown into the
straw in the body of the pung. But she sat on the
seat with Mr. Buckham when the colts started off
along the wood road.
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta sat down in the straw with her
father. Tom Jonah careered about the sleigh and
barked. Having seen the two strolling people
kindly treated by his little mistress and Mr. Buckham,
he gave over being suspicious of them.
</p>
<p>
The short winter day was drawing to a close.
On the rough road Mr. Buckham drove carefully
so as not to shake up his passengers, but once they
arrived at the more beaten track of the public
highway, he let the colts out and they sped swiftly
townward.
</p>
<p>
Agnes was afraid Tom Jonah would be left too
far behind and she begged Mr. Buckham to stop
so that the old dog might leap into the pung and
crouch at their feet in front. He was, indeed, well
spent.
</p>
<p>
“Not that you deserve to be helped at all, Tom
Jonah,” Agnes said sternly. “You disobeyed—and
ran away—and followed me. And I declare
you scared me pretty nearly into a fit, so you
did!”
</p>
<p>
But she did not say how glad she was that the
big dog had followed her into the wood. His presence
had saved her from a very awkward situation.
Though what Barnabetta and her father
could have done with her had they detained Agnes
at their camp, the Corner House girl was unable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
to imagine. To be a prisoner of the pair of strollers
would have been romantic, in Agnes’ opinion.
But—
</p>
<p>
“I believe I’d have been a white elephant on
their hands, if they’d kept me,” she thought, giggling.
</p>
<p>
The colts swept the party swiftly over the frozen
road to the old Corner House. The bells jingled
blithely, the runners creaked, the frost and the
falling darkness came together; and Agnes, at
least, felt highly exhilarated.
</p>
<p>
How the Scruggses felt she could only suspect.
They said nothing. If they were really astonished
by this Samaritan act, perhaps they still
held doubts regarding the end of the ride.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Scruggs, however, could not move his foot
without pain. It would have been impossible for
them to continue their journey to the South with
the member in its present condition.
</p>
<p>
The two circus people had left a local freight
at the water-tank that morning, intending to wait
for a through freight, running south, that was due
late in the evening. They hoped to steal aboard
this train—perhaps to pay some small sum to a
dishonest brakeman for a ride, and so travel a
long way toward their destination before being
driven from the train.
</p>
<p>
With the clown’s ankle in its present condition,
however, they never could have boarded the train.
He and Barnabetta had discussed their circumstances,
and were really at their wits’ end, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
Agnes had returned to them with the farmer and
his team.
</p>
<p>
Whatever may have been their doubts, they
could not afford to refuse the help thus proffered
them. Even a night in the police station would
have been preferable to that which faced them on
the snowy hillside overlooking the railroad tracks.
</p>
<p>
Wonderingly the two strollers arrived at the old
Corner House. Willow Street was almost bare of
snow; and there was straw laid down there, too.
So the farmer brought his team to a stop at the
front gate of the Corner House premises.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t try to get out, mister,” said Bob Buckham,
cordially, “till I tie these critters and blanket
’em. Then I’ll help you. You run in and tell
your sister she’s goin’ to have comp’ny,” he
added to Agnes, saying it that Ruth might have
time to adjust her mind to the idea of the strangers
coming in.
</p>
<p>
But this really was not needed, for Ruth was the
soul of hospitality. Nor could she ever bear to
refuse assistance to those who asked. Had Mrs.
MacCall not exercised her shrewd Scotch sense in
many cases, the eldest Corner House girl would
have been imposed upon by those seeking charity
who were quite undeserving.
</p>
<p>
Having experienced the squeeze of poverty herself,
Ruth Kenway knew well what it meant.
The generous provision of their guardian, Mr.
Howbridge, left a wide margin of money and other
means for the Corner House girls to use in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
charitable way, if not enough for the automobile
that Agnes so heartily craved.
</p>
<p>
When Asa Scruggs hobbled up to the big front
door, leaning on Mr. Buckham on one side and on
Barnabetta on the other, the door was wide open,
the lamp-light shone out in a broad, cheerful beam
across the verandah, and Ruth stood in the doorway
to welcome the guests.
</p>
<p>
The eldest Corner House girl, like her sister,
treated the poor clown and his daughter as though
they were most honored visitors. Their shabby
clothing, their staves, and their bundles done up
in blue denim bags, were accepted by Ruth as quite
a matter of course.
</p>
<p>
Visions of the police station and cells evaporated
from Barnabetta’s active and suspicious
brain. <em>This</em> was like entering a fairy castle in a
dream!
</p>
<p>
She and her father stared at each other. They
could not understand it. They could barely acknowledge
Ruth’s pleasantly worded welcome.
</p>
<p>
“Do come right upstairs, folks,” said Agnes,
fluttering down the stairway herself, with her hat
and coat removed. “I’m so glad you came in, Mr.
Buckham. You can help Barnabetta’s father up
to his room.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” agreed the farmer.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Ruth. “Unc’ Rufus is rheumatically
inclined to-day.” Then she added to Barnabetta:
“You and your father shall be in adjoining
rooms. Agnes will show you the bath.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
And I know you can wear a frock of mine, if you
will?”
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta could hardly speak. She had to
swallow something that felt like a big lump in her
throat. These girls, without any reason whatever,
were treating her as though she were one
of themselves. She knew she never would have
been so kind to a stranger as they were to her
father and herself.
</p>
<p>
Not only a frock did Barnabetta find laid out in
her room a little later—after she had helped her
father to bed; but there was linen and underclothing,
and even shoes and stockings. And a hot
bath was drawn for her in the bathroom with soap
and towels laid by. Oh! the forlorn circus girl
luxuriated in the bath.
</p>
<p>
Again and again the girl asked herself why she
and the clown were being treated so kindly.
</p>
<p>
Had Barnabetta known what Agnes had said to
Ruth when she ran in ahead of the rest of the
party, she might not have been so surprised by
Ruth’s kindness. Not a word did the younger girl
say about Barnabetta and her father having tried
to detain her in the woods.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruth! these poor folk are circus people.
They know Neale O’Neil. And Neale is with his
uncle in Tiverton, where he’s lying hurt. The circus
is in winter quarters there. <em>And the old album
is safe!</em>”
</p>
<p>
She did not say how she knew this last to be the
case; and Ruth was so busy making the visitors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
comfortable that she did not ask, but accepted the
good news unquestioningly.
</p>
<p>
Besides, Ruth had to give some attention to Mr.
Bob Buckham. She could allow no guest to be
neglected. The old farmer, however, would not
stay to dinner.
</p>
<p>
“That would never do—that would <em>never</em> do!”
he declared, when Ruth proposed it. “What
would Marm do without me at table? No, sir.
I just wanted to see these folks Aggie has taken
such a shine to, right to this old Corner House.
And say, Ruthie!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir?” was the girl’s response.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know nothin’ about who they be. Nor
do you, nor Aggie. So have a care.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, they must be all right, Mr. Buckham,”
cried Ruth. “Neale knows them. They are from
his uncle’s circus.”
</p>
<p>
“Eh? Neale knows ’em? Wal—mebbe so,
mebbe so,” grunted Mr. Buckham. “Just the
same, I know lots of folks I wouldn’t make too
free with. Wait and try ’em out,” advised the old
farmer.
</p>
<p>
If Ruth had had any doubts about the trapeze
artist and her father, she was at once disarmed
when Barnabetta came down to dinner. And
Agnes, forgetting her first unpleasant introduction
to the strollers in the woods, was delighted
with her protégé.
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta was a dark, glowing beauty. Her
curly hair, which made her look so boyish before,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
framed her thin, striking features most becomingly.
Her figure was lithe without being lean.
</p>
<p>
The little girls, who had not seen Barnabetta
arrive in her boy’s apparel, were taken with the
trapeze artist at once. Agnes had told them what
Barnabetta did in the circus, and of course Dot
was extremely interested.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” she said, her eyes shining and her
cheeks flushed. “Do—do you climb ‘way up on
those trapezers at the circus and turn inside outside,
just as we saw once? Oh! that must be just
heaveningly—mustn’t it, Tess?”
</p>
<p>
Tess was quite as excited over the guest herself,
and overlooked Dot’s new rendering of certain
words for the sake of asking:
</p>
<p>
“Doesn’t it make your head go round and round
like a whirligig, to turn over on the trapeze? It
does mine, though Neale showed me how to do it
on the bar he set up in our garret.”
</p>
<p>
The simple kindness and cordiality of the Corner
House girls was a distinct surprise to Barnabetta.
At first she showed something of her
doubt of this reception she was accorded by such
complete strangers. They were all so completely
different from her, and their manner of life so
entirely strange to her.
</p>
<p>
The dining room service, the soft lights, the
pleasant officiousness of Unc’ Rufus, and the girls’
own gay conversation, was all a revelation to the
circus performer. Even Aunt Sarah Maltby’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
grim magnificence at her end of the table helped
to tame the wildness of Barnabetta Scruggs.
</p>
<p>
If Mrs. MacCall did not altogether approve of
these circus people, she said nothing and did nothing
to show such disapproval. Barnabetta began
to see that these good folk were very simple
and kindly, and wished only to see her at her ease
and desired to make her feel at home.
</p>
<p>
She went back to the clown after dinner, to find
that he had been served with a great tray of food
by Linda, and lay back among his pillows, happy
and content.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. MacCall had insisted upon looking at his
ankle. She bandaged it and anointed it with balsam.
</p>
<p>
“These folks are mighty good people, Barnabetta,”
said Asa Scruggs. “I never knowed there
were such good folks outside the circus business.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to make of ’em,” confessed
the girl.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t have to make nothin’ of ’em,” said her
father, with a sigh of content. “This is somethin’
to be mighty thankful for. Feel the warm air
comin’ from that open register, Barnabetta? And
I thought we’d haf to scrouge down over a whisp
of fire to-night in the open. Oh, my!” and he
gave an ecstatic wriggle under the bed clothes.
</p>
<p>
He seemed ready for sleep, and the girl tiptoed
out of the room after turning the gas low. It was
while she was in the hall, and before opening the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
door of her own room, that she heard a sudden
subdued hullabaloo below stairs. Listen! what
had happened?
</p>
<p>
Startled, Barnabetta crept along the hall to the
front stairway. Somebody had entered by the
door from the side porch, bringing in a great
breath of keen air that drifted up the stairway to
her. The Corner House girls were conducting
this new arrival into the sitting room.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! you mean thing!” cried Agnes’
voice. “Where have you been? Come in and tell
us all about it!”
</p>
<p>
“And what have you done with that old album
Agnes let you take?” was Ruth’s anxious question.
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta strained her ears to distinguish the
boy’s reply.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—AT CROSS PURPOSES</h2>
<p>
Tess had been over to see how Sammy Pinkney
was after dinner. That was her usual evening
task now. She would go into the Pinkney yard
and yodle.
</p>
<p>
“Ee-yow! ee-yow! ee-yow!” That was the way
in which Sammy himself usually announced his
coming to the old Corner House, and Tess had
learned it from him.
</p>
<p>
Then Mrs. Pinkney would come to the side door
to speak to the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“How is Sammy to-night, Mrs. Pinkney?” Tess
would query. “We hope he’s better.”
</p>
<p>
And Mrs. Pinkney would tell her. In the morning
on her way to school, Tess would repeat the
inquiry. For a week the reports were very grave
indeed. Sammy knew nobody—not even his
father and mother. The poor little “pirate” was
quite delirious; his temperature was very high;
and Dr. Forsyth could give the parents little encouragement.
</p>
<p>
But this evening, for the first time, Tess’ shrill
little “Ee-yow! ee-yow! ee-yow!” was heard by
the boy inside, and recognized. Mrs. Pinkney
came running to the door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
</p>
<p>
“I do wish I dared run out and kiss you, Tessie
Kenway!” she cried, and there were tears of
thankfulness in her eyes. “Sammy heard you.
He’s better. Bless you, dear! He <em>is</em> better.
Yodle for him again.”
</p>
<p>
So Tess did, and right away there was an unexpected
answer. Somebody repeated “Ee-yow!
ee-yow! ee-yow!” behind her in Willow Street.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness gracious!” squealed Tess, running
wildly out of the gate, “is that you, Neale
O’Neil?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s who it is, honey,” said the white-haired
boy, cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! so much has happened since you’ve
been gone. Sammy’s got scarlet fever; but he’s
better. And Almira’s got four kittens. And
we’ve got visitors, and one of ’em’s a girl and she
can turn on the trapeze—so easy! And you’ve
got a whole heap of Christmas presents in the sitting
room that you’ve never seen yet.”
</p>
<p>
“All right. I’ll go in and see ’em right now,”
Neale said, and took her hand in his free one.
When they mounted the porch steps and Agnes
and Ruth and Dot came running to the door to
meet him, he dropped his heavy bag in a corner
and did not take it into the house. He had just
come from the railroad station.
</p>
<p>
“You see,” Neale said, when he was hustled
into the warm sitting room by the four Corner
House girls, and even before he took off his coat
and cap and gloves, “I got a letter about Uncle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
Bill Sorber from one of the other Sorbers. He
was hurt two months ago—badly burned, poor old
fellow!—when the circus arrived at winter quarters.
</p>
<p>
“They always give a last performance there at
Tiverton, and another when they start out in the
spring. There was an accident this time. A tank
of gasoline fell from aloft, and got afire, and Uncle
Bill was hurt badly. The doctors gave him up at
last, and so they sent for me.”
</p>
<p>
“I know about it,” said Agnes, nodding.
</p>
<p>
“How’d you know? Must have seen it in the
paper, I s’pose,” said Neale. “Well, I missed it.
I didn’t know a thing about his being hurt till I
found that letter at home Christmas Eve.”
</p>
<p>
“But why did you go away without telling us?”
Ruth asked earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t want to bother you girls, then. And
you expected me to help you at that Christmas tree
business, too. So I only left the note with Unc’
Rufus and told him not to give it to you till just
before dinner. I fixed it with Con Murphy to take
my place. He did, didn’t he?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” the eager Agnes said.
</p>
<p>
The little girls had danced off to the kitchen on
some errand. The boy continued:
</p>
<p>
“Well! I got up there to the winter quarters
and found Uncle Bill better. But the poor old
fellow had been asking for me. I don’t suppose
we ever will understand each other,” sighed Neale.
“He can’t see why I want to be something different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
from a circus performer; and an education
doesn’t mean a thing to him but foolishness.
</p>
<p>
“But I guess he really does have some interest
in me—”
</p>
<p>
“Of course he does, Neale,” interposed Ruth,
admonishingly. “I could tell that the time he was
here and I talked with him.”
</p>
<p>
“Just the same, I wish I had money myself, so’s
not to have to take any from him,” the boy said
stubbornly.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” burst out Ruth, “you have had plenty
of money with you lately, Neale O’Neil, whether
you know it or not! What under the sun have you
done with that great old book Aggie found in the
garret?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mercy, yes, Neale!” put in Agnes.
“What did you do with it? Ruth’s just about
worried her heart and soul out about it.”
</p>
<p>
“What for?” asked Neale, flushing deeply.
</p>
<p>
“Well, goodness!” cried Agnes. “I believe
that Ruth believes that old book is full of
money.”
</p>
<p>
“What of it?” asked Neale, still looking red
and angry.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Neale, we’d like to know what you’ve
done with it,” Ruth said, seriously. “Aggie had
no right to let you take the book.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” snapped the boy again.
</p>
<p>
“Because it was not hers. It does not belong
to us. It should not have gone out of my care.
It—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well! why didn’t you take care of it, then?”
demanded the boy, sharply.
</p>
<p>
“I—I didn’t know what was in it. I couldn’t
believe it!” declared Ruth, with clasped hands.
</p>
<p>
“For pity’s sake! what <em>is</em> the matter with you,
Ruth Kenway?” cried Agnes, feeling that they
were all at cross purposes. “If it was real money
or counterfeit, either one, of course Neale was to
be trusted with it, I should hope.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>If!</em>” ejaculated Ruth, desperately. “You
don’t know what you say, Agnes. There’s no ‘if’
about it. It is real money.”
</p>
<p>
“No?” gasped the astounded Agnes, who had
never really believed this was so. “How do you
know that, Ruth Kenway? It is preposterous.”
</p>
<p>
“It is so,” repeated Ruth, more calmly. “I
took one of the ten dollar bills and had it examined
at the bank. Mr. Crouch says it is good money.
I didn’t believe it myself till he said so. Then
I came back to find the book and lock it away
somewhere. And you had given it to Neale.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!” gasped Agnes, sitting down suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“Well! what if I did have it? And what if it is
good money?” repeated the white-haired boy, still
standing as though on the defensive. “Do you
think I’d run away with it, Ruth Kenway?”
</p>
<p>
“You <em>did</em> go away with it, didn’t you?” returned
Ruth, a little sharp herself, now. “I have
been worried to death.”
</p>
<p>
“But of course it’s all right,” Agnes hastened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
to put in, trying to throw oil on the troubled
waters. “You brought the old album back with
you, didn’t you, Neale?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I did,” Neale admitted. “But I’d like
to know what Ruth means by what she says. If
there <em>had</em> been a hundred thousand dollars in that
book do you s’pose I’d <em>steal</em> it?”
</p>
<p>
“A hundred thousand dollars!” murmured
Agnes. “Oh—dear—me!”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t know what to think,” Ruth said
slowly. “I have worried—oh! so much!” and she
sobbed.
</p>
<p>
“Because I carried away that old book?” repeated
Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Oh! it would have been just the same if
anybody had carried it off. I don’t know who
all that fortune belongs to; but we must take care
of it till Mr. Howbridge comes.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my goodness me!” squealed Agnes. “Is
it true? Can it be so? All—that—money?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure it isn’t ours,” Ruth said quietly.
“Uncle Peter never hid away any such sum. He
wasn’t as rich as all that. But we’ve got to give
an account of it to somebody.”
</p>
<p>
“What for?” demanded her sister. “I found
it.”
</p>
<p>
“But findings isn’t always keepings, Aggie—especially
where so much money is concerned. A
hundred thousand dollars!”
</p>
<p>
“A hundred thousand dollars!” repeated
Agnes, in the same awed tone.

<span class='caption'>“You think I’m a thief. I won’t stay here.”</span>
</div>
<p>
Neale pulled his cap tighter down over his ears.
It was an angry gesture.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you going, Neale?” demanded
Ruth, exasperated. “Do sit down and tell us
what you have done. Don’t you see we are anxious?
I never saw such a boy! Do tell us!”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know why I should tell you anything,”
returned the boy, grumpily enough. “You think
I’m a thief. I won’t stay here.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!” shrieked Agnes, seeing how serious
this difference was. “Don’t get mad.”
</p>
<p>
“Let him return the book,” said Ruth, insistently.
“This isn’t any foolish matter, I assure
you. He has no right to keep it.”
</p>
<p>
“Did I say I was going to keep it?” flared out
Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you have kept it. You carried it away
to Tiverton, you say,” went on Ruth, accusingly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, so I did,” admitted Neale.
</p>
<p>
“What for, I’d like to know?” demanded the
oldest Corner House girl in exasperation.
</p>
<p>
“I lugged it along to show to somebody.”
</p>
<p>
“What for—if you didn’t think it was good
money?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruth!” begged Agnes again. “Don’t!”
</p>
<p>
“I want him to answer,” cried her elder sister,
severely. “Why did he carry the album away?
And where is it now?”
</p>
<p>
It must be confessed that Ruth Kenway had
worked herself into a fever of excitement. It was
the result of the repressed anxiety she had so long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
endured regarding this strange and wonderful find
of Agnes’ in the old Corner House garret.
</p>
<p>
Neale was very pale now. He was usually slow
to anger, and his friends, the Corner House girls,
had never seen him moved so deeply before.
</p>
<p>
“I did think the bonds might be worth something,”
Neale said, at last, and hoarsely. “I told
Aggie so.”
</p>
<p>
“But the money?” cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“<em>You</em> say it’s good,” the boy returned. “You
can believe that’s so if you want to. I didn’t
think it was when I took the book.”
</p>
<p>
“I tell you Mr. Crouch, at the bank, said it was
perfectly good. See here!” cried Ruth, desperately.
</p>
<p>
She ran for her purse that lay on the sewing-machine
table. She opened it and drew forth the
folded ten dollar bill. With it came the other
bill she had put away.
</p>
<p>
“I showed him this!” Ruth began, when Agnes
stooped to pick up the other.
</p>
<p>
“What’s this?” the second sister asked.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why that’s the one Mr. Howbridge gave
me. I haven’t needed to break it.”
</p>
<p>
“And you had ’em both together?” demanded
Agnes, shrewdly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Which one did you show Mr. Crouch then?”
</p>
<p>
The question stunned Ruth for the moment.
She unfolded the bill she had taken out of the
purse. It was quite a new silver certificate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
Agnes unfolded the other. It was an old-style
United States banknote, dated long before the
girls’ parents were born.
</p>
<p>
Neale, as well as the Kenway sisters, saw the
significance of the discovery. The boy turned his
face aside quickly and so hid the smile that automatically
wreathed his lips.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why!” gasped Agnes, “if you showed
Mr. Crouch <em>that</em> bill, of course he said it was a
good one. But how about this?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth turned like a flash on Neale again.
“What do <em>you</em> know about the money in the book?
Isn’t it good?” she demanded. “I believe you’ve
found out.”
</p>
<p>
“Well! what if I have?” and one would hardly
recognize Neale O’Neil’s pleasant voice in the
snarling tone that now answered the oldest Corner
House girl.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! is it?” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
But Neale gave her no reply. He was still
glaring at Ruth whose expression of her doubt of
his honesty had rasped the boy’s temper till he
fairly raged.
</p>
<p>
“If you want to find out anything about that
stuff in the old book, you can do it yourself. I
won’t tell you. I’m through with the whole business,”
declared Neale.
</p>
<p>
“But—but where’s the book?” asked Ruth, in
rather a weak voice now.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I brought it back,” snapped Neale.
“You’ll find it outside on the porch—in my bag.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
That’s all I carried in the old thing, anyway. You
can have it.”
</p>
<p>
He marched to the door and jerked it open.
Agnes tried to call after him, but could not.
</p>
<p>
Neale banged to the door behind him and
tramped down the hall. They heard him open the
outer door and slam that. Then he thumped down
the steps and made for the Willow Street gate.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruth! what have you done?” gasped
Agnes, wringing her hands. “Poor Neale!”
</p>
<p>
“I want that album!” exclaimed Ruth, jumping
up.
</p>
<p>
“It—it can’t be worth anything—that money,”
murmured Agnes, but followed her sister.
</p>
<p>
“It <em>is</em> good money. I’m sure of it!” snapped
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
She hurried to the porch. There was Neale’s
old bag in the dark corner. Ruth pounced upon
it.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruth!” cried Agnes. “It’s never there.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it is. He didn’t stop when he went out.
Of course it’s here!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth had brought the satchel into the lighted
hall and opened it. She turned it upside down
and shook it.
</p>
<p>
But nothing shook out—not a thing. The bag
was empty. The old album Agnes had found in
the garret, and which had caused all their worry
and trouble, had disappeared from Neale’s satchel.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>
The two youngest Corner House girls had heard
nothing of this exciting discussion in the sitting
room between Neale O’Neil and their two older
sisters.
</p>
<p>
Tess and Dot had run to tell the rest of the family
that Neale had arrived and that Sammy Pinkney
was better. Mrs. MacCall, who had a soft
spot in her heart for the white-haired boy, put
down some supper to warm for him, sure that
Neale would come into the kitchen before he went
home.
</p>
<p>
Dot ran upstairs to Aunt Sarah Maltby’s room
to tell her of the boy’s arrival, and Aunt Sarah
actually expressed her satisfaction that he had
reached home in safety. Neale was growing
slowly in the brusk old lady’s good graces.
</p>
<p>
Coming downstairs and through the dining
room, where the gas-logs blazed cheerfully on the
hearth, Dot found Sandyface, the “grandmother”
cat, crouching close before the blaze, her forepaws
tucked in, and expressing her satisfaction at the
warmth and comfort in a manner very plain to be
heard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mercy me!” ejaculated the smallest Corner
House girl. “Sandyface! you sound just as
though you were beginning to boil! Oh!”
</p>
<p>
For just then the door from the rear hall opened
quickly and startled her. The strange girl—the
circus girl—who had so interested Dot and Tess,
to say nothing of the rest of the family, popped
in.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” repeated Dot. “How you frightened
me.”
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta stood with her back against the door.
One might have thought that the appearance of
Dot, had been quite as unexpected and had frightened
her.
</p>
<p>
She seemed breathless, too, as though she had
been running. But of course she had not been
running. Where should she have run to on such
a cold night? And there was no snow on her
shoes. Besides, she wore no wrap.
</p>
<p>
“Did—did I frighten you, little girl?” Barnabetta
said. “I am sorry, I did not mean to.”
</p>
<p>
She had both hands behind her and stood against
the door in a most awkward position.
</p>
<p>
“I was afraid you had gone to bed,” prattled
on Dot, stroking Sandyface. “Ruthie said she
s’posed you had. But I’m glad you hadn’t. I
wanted to ask you something.”
</p>
<p>
“Did—did you?” returned Barnabetta. She
seemed to be listening all the time—as though
something was going on in the hall that frightened
her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” Dot went on placidly. “You know,
we’ve been to a circus once.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that so?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. And Tess and I was awful int’rested in
it. We—we liked the ladies and gentlemans that
rode on the horses around the ring, and was on
the trapezers, too. And they looked <em>beau</em>-tiful
in those spangles, and velvets, and all.
</p>
<p>
“I s’pose those were their best clo’es, weren’t
they—their real, Sunday-go-to-meeting frocks?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I guess they were,” admitted Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“You wear <em>your</em> best clo’es when you go up on
the trapezers, don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“The fanciest I’ve got,” admitted the circus
girl.
</p>
<p>
“Well! Mustn’t they look funny all going to
church that way—the ladies in those short, fluffy
skirts, and the gentlemans in such tight pants!
My!” gasped Dot. “Couldn’t you tell us, please,
what they do in circuses when they travel?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—yes,” said Barnabetta. “I’ll tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you sit right down here and tell us?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, wait! I’ll run and fetch Tess!” exclaimed
the generous Dot. “I know she will want to hear,
too,” and she scampered out of the room so swiftly
that she startled Sandyface, who flew through the
door before her.
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta was left alone in the dining room.
There was a closet with a small door right beside
the fireplace. When Dot returned with Tess the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
circus girl was leaning her back against that closet
door, instead of against the hall door.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, <em>do</em> come and sit down,” urged Dot, eagerly,
drawing an armchair to the hearth.
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta did so. Tess and Dot each brought
a hassock, one on either side of the older girl.
Barnabetta had a softer side to her nature than
the side she had displayed to Agnes Kenway.
There were little folk at the circus, who traveled
with their parents with the show, who loved Barnabetta
Scruggs.
</p>
<p>
A little later Agnes, pale of face and with traces
of tears, came into the room. She and Ruth had
hunted high and low for the lost album Neale
O’Neil had left in his satchel on the side porch.
</p>
<p>
Even Ruth admitted Neale had not halted there,
when he went out so angrily, long enough to take
the album away. And both girls had seen him
drop the heavy bag in that dark corner when he
came in with Tess.
</p>
<p>
Somebody had removed the album. Nor was it
ridiculous to suppose that the “somebody” who
had done this knew very well what the book contained.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we’ve been robbed! robbed!” Ruth had
cried, rocking herself back and forth in her chair
in the sitting room. “What ever shall we do?
What shall I say to Mr. Howbridge?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care a thing about <em>him</em>,” declared
Agnes, recklessly. “But think of all that money—if
it is money—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
</p>
<p>
“I tell you it is.”
</p>
<p>
“But you don’t know for sure,” Agnes retorted.
“Maybe you showed Mr. Crouch the wrong
bill.”
</p>
<p>
“No. I’ve felt all the time,” Ruth said despairingly,
“that we really had a great fortune in
our hands. How it came to be hidden in our garret,
I don’t know. Whom it really belongs to I
don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“Us! We found it!” sobbed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“No. We cannot claim it. At least, not until
we have searched for the rightful owners. But
Mr. Howbridge will tell us.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! mercy me, Ruthie Kenway!” cried Agnes.
“What’s the use of talking? It’s go-o-one!”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know who—”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t blame Neale now!” flared up Agnes.
“You’ve made him mad, too. He’ll never forgive
us.”
</p>
<p>
“Well! What business had he to carry off that
book?” demanded Ruth. “He can be mad if he
wants to be. If he hadn’t carried it away there
would have been no trouble at all.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruthie! It isn’t his fault that somebody
has stolen it now,” repeated Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Why isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“How could it be?”
</p>
<p>
“Like enough the foolish boy showed all that
money to somebody, and he has been followed
right here to the house by the robber.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes gasped. Then she sat back in her chair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
and stared at her sister. Suddenly, with an inarticulate
cry, she arose and dashed upstairs.
</p>
<p>
Although she had not asked, Agnes supposed
the circus girl had retired immediately after dinner.
It was still early in the evening, and Agnes
and Ruth had had no private conversation regarding
Barnabetta and her father. Neale’s arrival
had driven that out of both their minds.
</p>
<p>
But into Agnes’ brain now came the thought
that Barnabetta had seen the old album full of
money and bonds while Neale was at the winter
quarters of the circus.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! Can she be so very, very
wicked?” thought Agnes. “They are so desperately
in need. And such an amount of money is
an awful temptation—that is, it would be a temptation
if it <em>were</em> money!”
</p>
<p>
For despite all that Ruth said, Agnes could not
believe that the wonderful contents of the old
album was bona fide money and bonds.
</p>
<p>
The thought, however, that Barnabetta might
be tempted to steal from those who had been kind
to her, troubled Agnes exceedingly. She did not
want to say anything to Ruth about her suspicions
of the circus girl yet. Why make her sister suspicious,
too, unless she was sure of her evidence?
</p>
<p>
Agnes listened at the door of Barnabetta’s
room. There was no sound in there and she
finally turned the knob softly and pushed open the
door a crack. The lighted room was revealed;
but there was no sign of occupancy save the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
shabby boy’s clothing folded on a chair. The bed
had not been touched.
</p>
<p>
Was the circus girl with her father? Or had
she left the house on some errand?
</p>
<p>
Agnes crept to the other door and put her ear
to the panel. At first she heard nothing. Then
came a murmur, as of voices in low conversation.
Were the circus people talking? Had Barnabetta
really gained possession of the book, and were
she and her father examining it?
</p>
<p>
Then Agnes suddenly fell to giggling; for what
she actually heard was Mr. Asa Scruggs’ rhythmic
snoring.
</p>
<p>
“She surely isn’t there,” decided Agnes, creeping
away down the hall again. “He’s sound
asleep. If Barnabetta’s up to any mischief—if
she’s taken that album—she can’t be in there with
it.”
</p>
<p>
It was immediately following this decision that
Agnes, returning downstairs by the front way,
heard voices in the dining room. She looked in
to see Barnabetta sitting with Tess and Dot before
the fire, telling the little girls stories of circus
life.
</p>
<p>
Agnes dodged out of there. She had seen
enough, she thought, to convince any one that
the circus girl was not guilty.
</p>
<p>
“Where’d you go to?” demanded Ruth, when
her sister returned to the sitting room.
</p>
<p>
“I went to see where that Barnabetta Scruggs
was,” confessed Agnes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my! I did not think of <em>them</em>.” Ruth said.
</p>
<p>
“Well, she’s all right. She’s in the dining room
telling Tess and Dot stories. It certainly could
not be Barnabetta. Why! we’d have heard her go
through the hall and out upon the porch.”
</p>
<p>
“Why! She doesn’t know anything about the
album,” retorted Ruth. “I tell you it’s been
stolen by somebody who followed Neale here to
the house.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, surely that couldn’t be Barnabetta,”
admitted Agnes; “for <em>she</em> got here first.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” Ruth agreed. “No. Somebody
followed that foolish boy—perhaps away
from Tiverton. And to think of his throwing
down a satchel of money on the porch in that careless
way!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but Ruthie! that proves Neale doesn’t believe
it is good money,” Agnes said eagerly.
“Else he wouldn’t have left it out there. Of
course he has found out that it is all counterfeit.”
</p>
<p>
“You never can tell what a foolish boy will do,”
retorted Ruth, tossing her head.
</p>
<p>
“Shall—shall we tell the police we’ve been
robbed?” hesitated Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Why should we tell them, I’d like to know?”
demanded Ruth, shortly. “What should we tell
them? That we’ve lost a hundred thousand dollars
that doesn’t belong to us?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mercy!”
</p>
<p>
“I’d be afraid to,” confessed the troubled Ruth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
“You don’t know what they might do to us for
losing it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, Ruthie! that sounds awful,” murmured
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
The two girls were in much vexation of spirit,
and quite uncertain what to do. The emergency
called for wisdom beyond that which they possessed.
Nor did they know anybody at hand with
whom they might confer regarding the catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
Agnes wanted to run after Neale and ask his
opinion. He might know, or at least suspect, who
it was that had taken the album out of the satchel.
</p>
<p>
But Ruth would not hear of taking Neale into
their affairs further. She was quite put out with
their boy friend. And Agnes, from past experience,
knew that when Ruth was in this present
mood it was no use to argue with her.
</p>
<p>
They spent a very unhappy evening indeed.
The two oldest Corner House girls, that is. As for
Tess and Dot, they reveled till bedtime in a new
and wonderful world—the circus world.
</p>
<p>
They listened to Barnabetta tell of long journeys
through the country, when the big animals,
like the camels and the elephants, marched by
night, and the great cages and pole-wagons and
tent-wagons, rumbled over the roads from one
“stand” to another. Of adventures on the way.
Of accidents when wagons broke down, or got into
sloughs. Sometimes cages burst open when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
accidents occurred, and some of the animals got
out.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, me!” cried Tess, so excited that she
could scarcely sit still. “To think of lions, and
tigers, and panthers running loose!”
</p>
<p>
“What’s a ‘panther,’ sister?” queried Dot,
puzzled. “Are panthers dangerous?”
</p>
<p>
“Very,” responded Tess, wisely. “Of
course.”
</p>
<p>
“Why—why, I didn’t s’pose <em>that</em> was so,” murmured
Dot.
</p>
<p>
“For pity’s sake!” Tess exclaimed, exasperated.
“What do you s’pose a panther is, anyway,
Dot Kenway?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—why,” stammered the smallest Corner
House girl, “I—I thought a panther was a man
who made pants.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, goodness to gracious, Miss Barnabetta!
Did you ever hear of such a child?” demanded
Tess, hopelessly. “She never will learn the English
language!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth came all too quickly to remind the little
girls that it was bedtime. Although much
troubled, the oldest Corner House girl did not forget
their guests’ comfort.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Scruggs was settled for the night and Barnabetta
was sure he would not need anything before
morning. She accepted a cup of hot cocoa
and a biscuit herself and took them up stairs with
her. Agnes did not appear again, and Barnabetta
did not know that she was being watched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
by a pair of troubled blue eyes from the darker end
of the hall.
</p>
<p>
Agnes had Barnabetta very much in her mind.
She and Ruth agreed to say nothing in their own
room about the mysterious disappearance of the
album. The door was open into the children’s
room and it was notorious that “little pitchers
have big ears.”
</p>
<p>
After they were in bed, Agnes still lay and
thought about Barnabetta. Was it possible that
the circus girl had obtained possession of the mysterious
old album?
</p>
<p>
It seemed ridiculous to believe such a thing.
Surely she had not removed it to her room, for
Agnes had been there and had looked for it.
Barnabetta had been quietly telling stories to Tess
and Dot downstairs all the evening.
</p>
<p>
Yet, the very fact that the circus girl was downstairs
troubled Agnes. Suppose she had come
down while Neale and Ruth and she, Agnes, were
talking so excitedly about the odd find that had
been made in the garret? Suppose Barnabetta
had heard most of their talk?
</p>
<p>
“Easy enough for her to have slipped out of the
door and grabbed that old book,” murmured
Agnes. “But then—what did she do with it? Oh,
dear me! How awful of me to suspect her of such
wickedness.”
</p>
<p>
In the midst of her ruminations she heard a
doorlatch click. The house had long since become
still. It was very near midnight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
Agnes sat up in bed and strained her ears to
catch the next sound. But there seemed to be no
further movement. Had somebody left one of the
bedrooms, or was it a draught that had shaken the
door?
</p>
<p>
The uncertainty of this got upon the girl’s
nerves. Somebody might be creeping downstairs.
Suppose it were Barnabetta?
</p>
<p>
“What would she go down again for?” Agnes
asked herself.
</p>
<p>
Yet even as she thought this and how ridiculous
it was, she crept out of bed. Ruth was sound
asleep. Nobody heard Agnes as she felt around
with her bare feet and got them into her fleece-lined
bedroom slippers. Then, wrapping her robe
about her, she tied the cord and found her bedroom
candle.
</p>
<p>
She lit this and went out into the hall, the door
being open. As she came noiselessly to the top
of the main stairway she saw the reflection of another
candle on the ceiling above the stairwell—a
bobbing reflection that showed somebody was
moving slowly down the lower flight.
</p>
<p>
Agnes, not daring to breathe audibly, shielded
her own light with her free hand, and hastened to
peer over the balustrade.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—THE KEY TO THE CLOSET</h2>
<p>
Agnes was too late to see who it was at the foot
of the front stairs. As she craned her head over
the railing guarding the gallery above, the person
with the candle went into the dining room.
</p>
<p>
This mysterious individual must have found the
door open. There was no clicking of a latch down
there. The figure had glided into the room with
the candle, and was immediately out of sight.
</p>
<p>
“Just as silent as a ghost!” breathed Agnes.
“Oh!”
</p>
<p>
She almost giggled aloud, for she remembered
the time when—oh! so very long ago—the Corner
House family had been troubled by a ghost in the
garret—or, as Dot seemed determined to call it,
“a goat.”
</p>
<p>
Ghost or no ghost, Agnes felt that she had to
see this thing through. Even a disembodied spirit
had no right to go wandering about the old Corner
House at night with a lighted bedroom candle
in its hand.
</p>
<p>
She ran lightly downstairs, still sheltering the
flame of her own candle with her hand. The dining
room door had been pushed quietly to; but it
was not latched.
</p>
<p>
Hiding her candle so that it should not shine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
through the crack of the door, Agnes pushed the
portal open again with her free hand. There was
a glimmer of light ahead.
</p>
<p>
The dining room was a large apartment. The
candle in the hand of the unknown made only a
blur of light at the far end of the room.
</p>
<p>
What was the bearer of the candle about? At
first Agnes could not discover. The candle was
near the door which opened into the hall near the
side porch door. Through that hall one could
easily reach the dark corner where Neale O’Neil
had thrown his satchel when he arrived at the old
Corner House that evening.
</p>
<p>
A number of thoughts were buzzing in Agnes
Kenway’s brain. In spite of herself she was unable
to disconnect thought of Barnabetta Scruggs
and the missing book of money and bonds. It
might be that the circus girl had descended the
stairs and, listening at the sitting room door while
Neale was there, had heard what he said about
the old book; and so slipped out and stolen the
album either just before Neale flung himself out
of the house, or just afterward. There would
have been time to do so in either case.
</p>
<p>
If Barnabetta knew nothing about the missing
album, why was she creeping about the house at
this unearthly hour? The question seemed, to
Agnes’ mind, to be unanswerable save as the answer
fitted the above probabilities.
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t really know that this is Barnabetta,”
Agnes’ excusing self objected.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
</p>
<p>
She did not wish it to be the circus girl. As
much as she desired to know what had become of
the album, she did not wish to find it in Barnabetta
Scruggs’ possession.
</p>
<p>
The candle in the hand of the figure Agnes followed
was suddenly raised higher. The Corner
House girl jumped and almost uttered a sharp
exclamation aloud. Why! Barnabetta was not as
tall as that!
</p>
<p>
This ghostly visitor to the dining room was an
adult. She saw its flowing robe now. The candle,
held so high, threw the shadow of the head on
the wall in sharp relief.
</p>
<p>
“Her hair’s done up in a ‘pug’ behind,” gasped
Agnes. “Who can it be? Mrs. MacCall, or—or
Aunt Sarah?”
</p>
<p>
The mysterious person was at the closet built
into the brickwork of the chimney-piece, not at the
hall door. That closet was a catch-all for all manner
of odds and ends. There were shelves up
high, as well as a deep bin underneath.
</p>
<p>
Agnes felt she must know who the person was
who was rummaging in the closet, and what she
was about. She softly extinguished her own
candle, and set it down on the floor in the hall.
Then she pushed the door open wider and ventured
into the dining room.
</p>
<p>
“Aunt Sarah!”
</p>
<p>
Agnes did not utter this ejaculation aloud; but
she was completely surprised.
</p>
<p>
The grim looking old woman was fumbling on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
the top shelf of the cupboard, and she was muttering
to herself in a most exasperated tone.
</p>
<p>
“Those dratted young ones are into everything!”
was Aunt Sarah’s complaint. “A body
can’t find a thing put away as it should be.”
</p>
<p>
She stepped back from the cupboard then. She
closed the door with an angry snap, and then
stood, meditating.
</p>
<p>
Agnes had darted around the big table and
crouched down. Aunt Sarah half turned from the
closet door; then she turned back again.
</p>
<p>
Was the old lady asleep or awake? Agnes did
not know that Aunt Sarah ever walked in her
sleep. But she knew that somnambulists did very
strange things, and, of course, Aunt Sarah might
be a sleep-walker.
</p>
<p>
Aunt Sarah Maltby proceeded to do a very
strange thing now. There was a heavy brass key
in the lock of the cupboard door. The old lady
suddenly turned the key, locked the door, withdrew
the key, and, clutching it tightly in her hand,
marched back toward the front hall door.
</p>
<p>
It was just at this moment that Agnes Kenway
was treated to a second surprise. She suddenly
realized that there was a third person in the
room!
</p>
<p>
It was because of no movement upon the part of
the mysterious third person that Agnes made this
exciting discovery. But she heard a quick sigh,
or intake of breath, somewhere at the lower end of
the room near the pantry door. She thought of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
Tom Jonah first of all; but then remembered that
the old dog had gone out at bedtime and had not
come in again.
</p>
<p>
Most exciting thoughts raced through Agnes
Kenway’s brain. She had followed Aunt Sarah
downstairs and into the dining room. But had
Aunt Sarah followed somebody else here, at midnight?
</p>
<p>
“What under the sun is going on?” was Agnes’
muttered comment. “My goodness! I wish Ruth
were here. Or Neale!”
</p>
<p>
The Corner House girl felt very much disturbed
indeed. She did not believe in ghosts; but she did
believe in burglars!
</p>
<p>
At that moment all thought of Barnabetta
Scruggs went out of Agnes’ troubled mind. Aunt
Sarah passed out of the dining room door into the
front hall and closed the door carefully behind
her. This left the great room in perfect darkness.
</p>
<p>
Agnes was actually trembling with excitement
and fear. She had not thought to be afraid at all
until she heard that mysterious sigh. The fact
that she had no means of identifying the midnight
marauder increased her fright.
</p>
<p>
There it was again—a short intake of breath!
Somebody was surely hiding at the lower end of
the room. Agnes must have come into the room
so quietly that the unknown person did not apprehend
her presence.
</p>
<p>
Fearful as she was, Agnes did not move. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
her presence was not already discovered she
had no intention whatever of revealing it to the
unknown.
</p>
<p>
There was suddenly a faint sound, as of a
clumsily shod foot striking against one of the
heavy chairs. Agnes could see nothing at first;
but she seemed actually to feel the moving presence
at the lower end of the room.
</p>
<p>
There are degrees of darkness just as there are
of light. Something darker—or more solid—than
the atmosphere of the dining room, passed across
the line of Agnes’ vision.
</p>
<p>
The moving figure approached the cupboard in
the chimney-place. Agnes knew that the unknown
person stood just where Aunt Sarah had stood
shortly before.
</p>
<p>
A tentative hand shook the closet door gently.
It rattled; but the old lock was a strong one.
Nothing less than a crowbar or a burglar’s
jimmy could have forced that door.
</p>
<p>
Evidently the mysterious marauder was not
armed with either of these implements. Agnes
heard a sigh that was almost a sob! Then she
knew that the disappointed unknown had turned
hopelessly from the closet door.
</p>
<p>
Whatever it was this person wanted, Aunt Sarah
had locked it up in the cupboard and carried away
the key.
</p>
<p>
Agnes, crouching beyond the table, realized that
the visitor glided to the door leading into the back
hall. The door was opened. For a single instant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
the figure was partially revealed in outline to the
girl’s straining vision.
</p>
<p>
It was the figure of a man!
</p>
<p>
Then the door closed on its exit. Agnes sprang
to her feet. Had the unknown one not closed the
door, he must have heard her then, for Agnes was
too excited by her last discovery to be at all careful.
</p>
<p>
“A man! A man in the house!” thought the
terrified girl. And then, remarking a single
peculiarity of the mysterious figure, she whispered:
“Not a man, but a boy. Goodness! who
can it be?”
</p>
<p>
Quick as a flash Agnes Kenway ran to the door
leading into the front hall, by which she had entered.
She opened it and slipped into the hall.
Neglecting her candle which she had placed on the
floor for safety, she crept back toward the darker
end of the hall.
</p>
<p>
There was an “elbow” in the passage behind
the front stairway and she could not see beyond
this. But she heard a sound—the unmistakable
sound of a bolt being drawn.
</p>
<p>
Was the mysterious visitor at the porch door?
Was he leaving the house? And how had he got
in?
</p>
<p>
Agnes waited breathlessly for some further
noise. But there was none.
</p>
<p>
Five minutes passed. Then ten. The seconds
were being ticked off in a ghostly fashion by the
tall clock behind her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p>
Agnes crouched in the corner and trembled.
Usually she was brave; but the experiences of the
last half hour had gotten upon the girl’s nerves.
</p>
<p>
At last she could remain quiet no longer. She
stole to the rear of the dark hall—past the sitting
room door and beyond leading into the dining
room, and through which the boy had passed.
</p>
<p>
This end of the passage was comparatively narrow.
Agnes could be sure that nobody was hiding
here, for some light filtered down the back
stairway from the floor above.
</p>
<p>
Before her was the door of the porch. She
fumbled for the knob, and found it. She opened
the door easily. This was the bolt she had heard
drawn.
</p>
<p>
Here Agnes suffered the very worst scare of the
whole adventure. Something cold and wet was
thrust against her hand!
</p>
<p>
She almost screamed aloud. She <em>would</em> have
screamed, only the fright of it made her lose her
voice. She swung there, clinging to the doorknob,
about to fall fainting to the floor, when a
bulky object pushed by her and she heard Tom
Jonah’s whine.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! You dear, old, foolish, mean, silly
thing!” gasped Agnes. “<em>How</em> you scared me.
I’ll never forgive you, Tom Jonah! But I’m so
glad it’s only you.”
</p>
<p>
This she whispered, while she hugged the shaggy
dog. Tom Jonah had evidently found it too cold
for comfort outside the house, and hearing her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
at the door had come to beg entrance for the
night.
</p>
<p>
She let him into the kitchen and then, as she
went back to the door, she was suddenly smitten
with this thought:
</p>
<p>
“If that boy went out of that door, Tom Jonah
must have known him!”
</p>
<p>
The old dog had known him so well that he made
no objection to his being about the old Corner
House. There was but one boy in the world whom
Tom Jonah would allow to do such a thing. That
was Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
The thought gave Agnes Kenway a feeling of
dire dismay. She could not understand it. She
could not believe it.
</p>
<p>
Yet she was sure the boy had gone out by this
door. But how he had first got into the house
was a mystery beyond her divination.
</p>
<p>
At once she shot the bolt again. Once out, the
youthful marauder, whoever he was, should stay
out, as far as this particular means of entrance
was concerned.
</p>
<p>
“It couldn’t be a real burglar,” murmured
Agnes, quiveringly. “Oh, Neale! I wouldn’t
have thought it of you!
</p>
<p>
“And Aunt Sarah must have scared him when
he was at that closet. But, goodness me! what
would Neale O’Neil want in that old closet?
Nothing there much but medicines on the top shelf
and old books and papers. I—don’t see—
</p>
<p>
“<em>Could</em> it be a really, truly burglar, after all?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
Not one like Dot’s plumber, but a real one? And
why didn’t Tom Jonah bark? Oh, goodness! suppose
he hasn’t gone out after all?
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I want to go to bed and cover my head up
with blankets!” gasped Agnes. “I want to tell
Ruth—but I daren’t! Maybe I ought to call
everybody and make a search for the burglar.
But suppose it <em>should</em> be Neale?”
</p>
<p>
So she stole up to bed, shaking with nervous
dread, yet feeling as though she ought, somehow,
to be congratulated. Yet when she had slipped
off her robe and was in bed again, two separate
and important thoughts assailed her:
</p>
<p>
Had Barnabetta Scruggs been out of her room?
And what had Aunt Sarah Maltby done with the
key to the dining room closet?
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—LEMUEL ADEN’S DIARY</h2>
<p>
Agnes slept so late that Sunday morning that
she had to “scrabble,” as she herself confessed,
to get down to breakfast before everybody else
was through.
</p>
<p>
As the members of the Corner House family
who had risen earlier made no remarks about
burglars in the night, Agnes decided she would
better say nothing of her own experience.
</p>
<p>
It really seemed to Agnes now as though it had
been a dream. Only she noticed when she sat
down at the table that the big brass key was missing
from the lock of the closet door.
</p>
<p>
Aunt Sarah said nothing at that time about her
midnight rambling; nor about what she had locked
up in the chimney-place cupboard. Ruth looked
much worried and disturbed. Of course, the missing
album had not come to light. Ruth truly believed
that a great fortune had been within their
grasp and it was now utterly gone.
</p>
<p>
“And gone beyond redemption. We shall never
see it again,” she said to Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Agnes did not want to discuss this with her sister.
She was quite as puzzled as was Ruth over
the disappearance of the old album in which had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
been pasted the bonds and money; only she could
not bring herself to believe, as Ruth did, that the
bonds and money were good.
</p>
<p>
She wondered if Neale O’Neil had found the
answer to this problem while he was in Tiverton.
Then she winced when she thought of Neale. He
did not appear at the old Corner House on this
Sunday morning, as he usually did.
</p>
<p>
They must wait until Monday for Ruth to go to
the bank again and have the right ten dollar bill
examined. She admitted that she might have
shown the new banknote instead of the old one to
Mr. Crouch.
</p>
<p>
“Though lots of good it will do us to know for
certain whether the money was good and legal
tender or not, now that it has been stolen,” Ruth
grieved.
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta appeared at breakfast and Agnes
noticed that the circus girl’s eyes were red and her
manner much subdued.
</p>
<p>
The Corner House family prepared for church
much as usual. Aunt Sarah always made most
of her preparations—even to the filling of her
dress pocket with a handful of peppermint lozenges—the
night before.
</p>
<p>
Time was when the Kenway sisters had to
scrimp and save to find the five pennies weekly to
purchase Aunt Sarah’s supply of peppermints;
now they were bought in quantity and—
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see why you young ones can’t leave
’em alone,” said the old lady, severely, as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
swept down into the hall in her best silk dress and
popped the first lozenge of the day into her mouth.
</p>
<p>
“I forgot ’em last night till I’d got to bed, and
when I come down here for ’em, I declare I
couldn’t scurce find ’em in that cupboard. But I
got ’em locked away now an’ I guess you won’t
be so free with ’em.”
</p>
<p>
At this Agnes was attacked by “a fit of the giggles,”
as Aunt Sarah expressed it. But the girl
was not laughing at Aunt Sarah. Her thought
was:
</p>
<p>
“My goodness me! was <em>that</em> what the burglar
was after—Aunt Sarah’s peppermints?” But she
missed seeing Barnabetta’s face at this juncture.
</p>
<p>
Dot cried: “Oh, my, Miss Barnabetta! don’t
you feel well a-<em>tall</em> this morning?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, my dear, I am quite well,” said the
circus girl, hastily.
</p>
<p>
Tess said doubtfully: “I—I hope we didn’t
tire you last night asking for stories?”
</p>
<p>
“No, indeed.”
</p>
<p>
“But you just <em>did</em> look as though you were going
to faint,” said Dot.
</p>
<p>
“There, there,” said Mrs. MacCall. “Appearances
aren’t everything. The looks of a toad
don’t tell how far he’s goin’ to hop.”
</p>
<p>
“No-o,” agreed Tess. “And, anyway, toads
are very useful animals, even if they are so very
ugly.”
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta had the two little girls again, one on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
either side of her, before the fire. She had plainly
become their fast friend.
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta said, more cheerfully: “Toads are
not always ugly. Didn’t you ever see a toad early
in the mornin’—when the grass and everything is
all sparklin’ with dew? Oh! I must tell you a
story about <em>that</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Do, Miss Barnabetta,” breathed Tess, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! that will be lovely!” murmured Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Once upon a time a little brown toad—a very
warty toad—lived in a little house he had scooped
for himself in the dirt right under a rose tree.
He was a very sensible, hard-workin’ toad, only
he grieved because he was so ugly.
</p>
<p>
“He never would have known he was so ugly,
for he had no mirror in his house, if it hadn’t
been for the rose. But lookin’ up at the buddin’
rose, he saw how beautiful she was and knew that
in contrast he was the very ugliest beast that
moved upon the earth.”
</p>
<p>
“The poor thing!” murmured Tess, the tender-hearted.
</p>
<p>
“He near about worshipped that rose,” pursued
Barnabetta, her own eyes brighter as the
children followed her story breathlessly. “Every
day he watched her unfold her petals more and
more. He caught all the bugs and flies and ugly
grubs he could to keep them from comin’ at the
rose and doin’ her harm.
</p>
<p>
“Then came the mornin’,” said Barnabetta,
“when the rose was fully unfolded. The dew overnight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
had bejeweled each petal and when the first
rays of the sun hurried to kiss her, the dewdrops
sparkled like all manner of gems and precious
stones.
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, see!’ sighed the poor toad, ‘how beautiful
is the rose and how ugly I am.’
</p>
<p>
“But the rose heard him and she looked kindly
down upon the poor toad. She knew how faithfully
he had guarded her from the creepin’ and
flyin’ things that would have spoiled her beauty.
</p>
<p>
“‘Come here,’ she said to the toad, bendin’
down upon her stalk to see him better. And the
toad hopped close beneath her. ‘Come here,’ said
the rose, ‘and I will make you, too, beautiful.’
</p>
<p>
“And then she called to the mornin’ breeze,
‘Shake me!’ and the breeze did so—ever so gently—and
all the sparklin’, twinklin’ precious gems
of dewdrops shook off the rose and fell upon the
toad in a shower.
</p>
<p>
“And at once,” laughed Barnabetta, “the toad
was covered with diamonds, and spangles, and
glistenin’ drops of dew in which the sun was reflected,
till the toad appeared to be encased in an
armor of silver, trimmed with jewels, and all the
creatures in the garden cried:
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh! how beautiful is the toad!’”
</p>
<p>
Agnes listened with delight to this fantasy from
the trapeze performer. This gentle girl, telling
pretty tales to Tess and Dot, was quite another
person from “Barney” Scruggs, who had been
tramping in boy’s clothing with the old clown.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p>
“She <em>can’t</em> be wicked enough to have stolen that
scrap-book,” Agnes told herself, with increasing
confidence. “Dear me! I wish I’d never found
the old thing up garret.”
</p>
<p>
The four Corner House girls went to church
with Mrs. MacCall and Aunt Sarah. But Barnabetta
would not go. She excused herself by saying
that she did not wish to leave her father alone.
</p>
<p>
Sunday school followed the preaching service
almost immediately; but as soon as this was over,
Agnes hurried home. Ruth, with Tess and Dot,
went around by the hospital to call on Mrs. Eland,
the matron, and to enquire after Miss Pepperill.
</p>
<p>
They chanced to find the little gray lady sitting
at her desk, and with certain yellowed old papers
and letters, and several small books with ragged
sheepskin covers, before her.
</p>
<p>
“These were Uncle Lemuel’s,” she explained to
Ruth, touching the dog’s-eared books. “His
diaries. It does seem as though he loved to put
down on paper all his miserly thoughts and accounts
of his very meanest acts. He must have
been a strange combination of business acumen
and simple-mindedness.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish for your sake, Mrs. Eland,” Ruth said,
“that he had kept to the very day of his death the
riches he once accumulated.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I wish so, too—for Teeny’s sake,” replied
Mrs. Eland, referring to her unfortunate sister
by the pet name she had called her in childhood.
</p>
<p>
“Are these the books and papers Mr. Bob Buckham brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
you from the Quoharie poorhouse,
where Mr. Aden died?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I have never read through the diaries.
I only wanted to find an account of the five hundred
dollars belonging to Mr. Buckham’s father that
<em>my</em> father turned over to Uncle Lemuel.
</p>
<p>
“But here are notes of really vast sums. Uncle
Lemuel must have really been quite beside himself
long before he died. In one place he writes about
drawing out of several banks sums aggregating
over fifty thousand dollars.
</p>
<p>
“Think of it!” and Mrs. Eland sighed. “It
was at the time of the panic. He speaks of being
distrustful of banks. So he drew out all he had.
But, of course, he did not have so much money
as that. Fifty thousand dollars!”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he did have it,” said Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Then what became of it? He writes in one
place of losing a hundred dollars in some transaction,
and he goes on about it, in a raving way, as
though it was every cent of money he ever owned,”
declared Mrs. Eland. “Oh, dear! What a terrible
thing it must be to be a miser.”
</p>
<p>
“But—but suppose he <em>did</em> have so much money
at one time?”
</p>
<p>
“He dreamed it,” laughed the hospital matron.
</p>
<p>
“You’re not sure,” ventured the Corner House
girl.
</p>
<p>
“Then what became of it? I am sure he never
gave it away,” Mrs. Eland said, shaking her
head. “And here, where he speaks of coming to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
live with your Uncle Peter Stower, in the very last
year of his life, Uncle Lemuel says:
</p>
<p>
“‘Peter Stower always was a fool. He’ll give
me bite and sup as long as I need. Let him believe
me rich or poor as he pleases.’”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me,” sighed Ruth, “I always have felt
bad because Uncle Peter turned him out and Mr.
Aden wandered away to die at the Quoharie poorhouse.
Your uncle couldn’t have been in his right
mind.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course he wasn’t,” rejoined Mrs. Eland.
“Why! it shows that here. On almost the last
page of his diary—it was written after he left the
old Corner House—he says:
</p>
<p>
“‘I don’t trust banks; but Peter Stower is too
mean to be dishonest. My book is safe with him.’
</p>
<p>
“I suppose,” the little gray lady said, “Uncle
Lemuel had an idea of sending these diaries to
your Uncle Peter to keep for him. I can’t think
of any other book he was referring to.”
</p>
<p>
“A book?” murmured Ruth, quaveringly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. And once before he speaks here—where
is it?—of his diary, I suppose, as his ‘beautiful
book.’ Ah! here it is: ‘Have pasted all my
Wash. &amp; Pitts. R. R. B.‘s in my beautiful book.’
Now,” and Mrs. Eland laughed, “what do you
suppose ‘Wash. &amp; Pitts.’ means?”
</p>
<p>
Ruth sprang up, trembling, and with clasped
hands.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mrs. Eland!” she cried, “‘Washington &amp;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
Pittsburgh’—and he meant railroad bonds, of
course! It must be! it <em>must</em> be!”
</p>
<p>
“Well—but—my dear!” said Mrs. Eland,
amazed by Ruth’s excitement. “Of course, Uncle
Lemuel may have meant that. However, there
are no bonds of any kind pasted into these books.
I am sure of that,” and she laughed again, but
rather ruefully.
</p>
<p>
Ruth Kenway could not join in her laughter.
She had made a tremendous discovery—and one
that filled her with actual terror. She scarcely
knew how she managed to excuse herself from the
hospital matron’s presence, and got out upon the
street again with Tess and Dot.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—“EVERYTHING AT SIXES AND SEVENS”</h2>
<p>
“I do declare,” said Agnes Kenway, that very
evening. “We don’t seem like ourselves. The
house doesn’t seem like our house. And we’re all
at sixes and sevens! What ever is the matter with
Ruthie?”
</p>
<p>
For the eldest Corner House girl had spoken
crossly to Tess, and had fairly shaken Dot for
leaving a chocolate-cream on a chair where she,
Ruth, sat down upon it in her best dress, and
finally she had flown out of the sitting room in
tears and run up to bed.
</p>
<p>
“And Neale didn’t stay to eat supper last night,
and he hasn’t been here to-day,” grieved Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s all his Christmas presents,” said Dot.
“Don’t you s’pose he wants them a-tall? Is Neale
mad, too?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid Ruthie is coming down with something—like
Sammy Pinkney with the scarlet
fever,” Tess said, in a worried tone.
</p>
<p>
Agnes knew that it must be worry over the lost
album and money that had got upon her older sister’s
nerves. But even she did not suspect the
full measure of Ruth’s trouble, for the latter had
said nothing about the discovery in Lemuel Aden’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
old diary. But Agnes heartily wished she had
never made that odd find in the garret.
</p>
<p>
She had not seen Barnabetta save at dinner
time, and the clown had not left his room. Agnes
was troubled about Barnabetta. The little girls
found the trapeze artist a most delightful companion;
but Barnabetta had scarcely a word to say
to either of the older Corner House sisters.
</p>
<p>
As for Neale—Agnes Kenway could have cried
about Neale. She and the white-haired boy had
been the very best of friends.
</p>
<p>
“And I’m sure <em>I</em> didn’t say anything to anger
him. He needn’t have got mad at <em>me</em>,” was
Agnes’ thought. “Whatever he wanted in that
closet last night—
</p>
<p>
“There! I won’t believe it was Neale at all.
Why should he want to <em>steal</em> anything here, when
he could have had it for the asking?
</p>
<p>
“But who else could have gotten out of that
porch door, past Tom Jonah, without being eaten
up?” murmured poor Agnes. “Oh, dear me! how
can I believe it of him?”
</p>
<p>
Really, everything <em>was</em> at sixes and at sevens.
The week began badly. The two smallest Corner
House girls seemed afflicted with a measure of the
unhappiness that cloaked Ruth, Agnes and their
guest, Barnabetta Scruggs.
</p>
<p>
Dot actually quarreled with Mabel Creamer! It
came about in this wise:
</p>
<p>
After school on Monday the smallest Corner
House girl had been to the store for Mrs. MacCall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
Coming home, as she came past the Creamer
cottage she heard Mrs. Creamer scolding Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“You bad, bad girl!” the unwise mother was
saying to the sullen Mabel. “I should think your
little brother <em>would</em> cry whenever you come near
him. You don’t deserve to have a dear, baby
brother. Get out of my sight, you naughty
child!”
</p>
<p>
When Mabel appeared at her gate to face the
wondering Dot, she did not look heart-broken because
Bubby had taken a sudden dislike to her.
</p>
<p>
“What ever is the matter, Mabel Creamer?”
asked the smallest Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
“Oh—nothin’. Only I just fixed that kid for
once,” declared Mabel, with impish satisfaction.
“I don’t believe they’ll leave me to watch him all
the time while Lyddy and Peg go off to a movin’
pitcher show.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my!” said the awe-struck Dot. “What
ever did you do?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you what I did, Dot Kenway,” said
Mabel, dropping her voice to a whisper. “Bubby
wants to be played with all the time. You don’t
get a minute to call your soul your own,” she
added, quoting some of her elders.
</p>
<p>
“So, if he wanted to be amused all so fine, I
amused him. I smeared molasses on his fingers
and then I gave him a feather out of the pillow.
Oh, he was amused! He was trying to pick that
feather off his fingers for half an hour, and was
just as still as <em>still!</em> It might ha’ lasted longer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
too, only he got mad with the feather, and bawled.”
</p>
<p>
Dot did not know whether to laugh at, or be
horrified by, such depravity as this. But she was
glad that Mabel was free to go home with her at
this time, for Tess had been kept after school.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got four of just the cunningest kittens,”
Dot said, to her visitor. “Of course, they
are really Almira’s. Santa Claus got them for
her. But we <em>call</em> them ours.”
</p>
<p>
“My! isn’t that fine?” cried Mabel. “We’ve
got two cats, but they’re lazy old things. <em>They</em>
never have any kittens. We call them Paul and
Timothy.”
</p>
<p>
Almira’s young family still nested upon Unc’
Rufus’ old coat in the woodshed. Dot put two in
her apron to bring them out on the porch where
the cunning little things could be seen. But when
Mabel grabbed up the other two there was a good
deal of noise attending the operation.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Mabel! don’t hurt them,” cried Dot.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not hurting them,” responded Mabel,
sharply. “I’m carrying them just as careful as
I can by their stems.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear—<em>don’t!</em>” shrieked Dot, quite horrified.
“Them’s their tails, Mabel Creamer.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! what else are they for, I’d like to
know?” propounded the visitor. “A cat’s tail
is made for it to be grabbed by.”
</p>
<p>
“You—you——You’re cruel, Mabel Creamer!”
gasped Dot. “Put them down!”
</p>
<p>
She tumbled the two staggering kittens out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
her own lap and ran to rescue the poor, squalling
mites in Mabel’s hands. Mabel was not a child
to be driven in any case. There was a struggle.
Dot rescued the two little mites, but Mabel slapped
the little Corner House girl’s cheek twice—and
her hand left its mark.
</p>
<p>
“You’re a nasty little thing, Dot Kenway!”
scolded Mabel, marching down the steps and out
at the gate. “I never <em>did</em> like you much, and I
just <em>hate</em> you, now.”
</p>
<p>
Dot sat down, sobbing, on the step, and nursed
the bruised cheek. The four little kittens
squirmed all over her lap and tumbled about like
drunken caterpillars—and that helped some. For
soon the tears were dried and Dot began to laugh
at their antics. Just the same, Mabel’s blow had
left a bruise upon the smallest Corner House girl’s
heart which she long remembered.
</p>
<p>
Tess had had a rather hard day, too. Of course,
there was a new teacher ruling over the eighth
grade; and strict as Miss Pepperill had been, even
Sammy Pinkney would have been glad to “swap
back” for the red-haired teacher, after a session’s
experience with Miss Grimsby.
</p>
<p>
Miss Grimsby was young, but she looked a lot
older than most of the other teachers. She wore
her sleek, black hair brushed straight back from a
high, blue-veined forehead. She wore enormous,
shell-bowed spectacles.
</p>
<p>
Miss Grimsby was what is known as a substitute
teacher. She had brought to her work in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
eighth grade the very newest ideas about teaching
taught in the normal schools. She knew all
about her textbooks, and how to teach the studies
allotted her; but she did not know the first living
thing about those small animals known as boys
and girls.
</p>
<p>
She was fond of standing up before the class
and giving little lectures upon a multitude of subjects.
This method of teaching was much approved
by the faculty of the normal college from
which Miss Grimsby had just graduated.
</p>
<p>
Poor Jakey Gerlach had already come into conflict
with the new teacher, and once having decided
that Jakey was a “bad” boy, Miss Grimsby saw
him only in that peculiar light, no matter what
he did.
</p>
<p>
“Children,” said she, on one occasion, “you
should be able to do anything equally well with
either hand. That is called ‘being ambidextrous.’
See! I write with either hand, like this,” and she
illustrated with chalk upon the blackboard.
</p>
<p>
“With a little practice you will find it just as
easy to do anything with one hand as it is with
the other. Will you try? Jakey Gerlach! What
are you squirming there for in that disgraceful
manner?”
</p>
<p>
“I—I—please, Teacher,” stammered Jakey, “I
was only trying to put mine left hand in mine
right-hand trousers’ pocket.”
</p>
<p>
And Jakey remained after school for this. He
was not alone in his punishment. More than half
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
the eighth grade began to report late at their
homes nowadays.
</p>
<p>
On this special “blue Monday,” Tess Kenway
was one of the unfortunates. Without being a
goody-goody girl, Tess had a remarkable record
for deportment. It hurt her cruelly to be told
to remain with the other culprits on this occasion.
</p>
<p>
Nor did she think she deserved the punishment.
It came about through her trying to help Etta
Spears, who sat across the aisle from Tess.
</p>
<p>
Etta got up to recite and dropped her slate pencil.
When the next girl, Julia Bowen, was called
to arise, she would be sure to put her foot upon
the pencil and break it. So Tess leaned from her
seat to rescue the pencil.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing—crawling on the floor
there—Theresa?” demanded Miss Grimsby,
sharply.
</p>
<p>
“I—I was reaching for this pencil, please,
Teacher,” said Tess, holding up her prize.
</p>
<p>
“Bring it here instantly! If you can’t keep
your pencils in their proper place in your desk,
you must lose them.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but <em>please</em>, Miss Grimsby! It isn’t my
pencil,” gasped Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Then, what are you doing with it?” demanded
the teacher, severely.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Teacher!” almost sobbed Tess.
</p>
<p>
“Bring that pencil here!”
</p>
<p>
“But it is Etta’s!” Tess, in desperation, cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
</p>
<p>
“How came it on the floor?”
</p>
<p>
“She dropped it, Teacher.”
</p>
<p>
“Bring it here. Etta will go without her pencil
for a day. You, Theresa, will remain after
school for interfering with the pencil and for interrupting
the class.
</p>
<p>
“Next girl! Julia Bowen! Rise!”
</p>
<p>
So Tess was not at home when Mabel Creamer
slapped Dot and broke the truce that had endured
for a long time between the Creamer cottage and
the old Corner House.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Dot told her all about it. Tess was
the gentlest child imaginable, but that Dot should
have been struck, stirred the older sister “all
up.”
</p>
<p>
“The awful thing!” she gasped. “Why—why
didn’t you call Ruthie—or Aggie?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—ee!” said Dot, slowly. “What good
would that do, Tessie? They couldn’t put the
slap back. My face would have ached just the
same.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind, dear,” crooned Tess. “I’ll give
you my best pencil. I don’t much care for pencils
any more, anyway.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth had been to the bank again at noon. She
showed the old banknote to the cashier, Mr.
Crouch being out. The cashier said the bill was
perfectly good.
</p>
<p>
“And that settles it,” she said, wearily, to
Agnes, on their way home from school. “If one
bill is good the others must be.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I can’t believe it!” murmured Agnes.
“Fifty thousand dollars in cash!”
</p>
<p>
“And as much more in unregistered railroad
bonds. They were perfectly good, too—and there
must be a lot of dividends due upon them. Oh,
a fortune indeed!” groaned Ruth, in conclusion.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t believe it,” repeated her astonished
sister.
</p>
<p>
“<em>I</em> can believe it—very easily,” Ruth retorted.
It was on the tip of her tongue to tell Agnes that
all that fortune they had lost belonged to Mrs.
Eland and Miss Pepperill. But Agnes said:
</p>
<p>
“But Neale could not possibly have known it
was good.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Neale!” exclaimed Ruth, exasperated.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t really believe he would do anything
wrong, do you, Ruthie?” queried Agnes, pleadingly.
</p>
<p>
“He did enough wrong when he carried that
book away with him to Tiverton.”
</p>
<p>
“But <em>I</em> let him have the book,” Agnes confessed.
</p>
<p>
“He had no right to go off with it,” the other
said stubbornly. “And when he brought it back,
why did he throw it down there on the porch in
that careless manner?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course he didn’t know the money was
good,” Agnes repeated, trying to bolster up her
own shaking faith in Neale O’Neil.
</p>
<p>
For a very unhappy thought had come into
Agnes’ mind. Ruth had been so certain that the
money and the bonds were good that she might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
have convinced Neale that evening, when he had
come home from Tiverton. Agnes was quite sure
he had not considered the printed banking paper
worth anything before that time. Had he found
a chance to take the book out of the bag and hide
it after he had flung himself in anger out of the
sitting room?
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know how he could have done it,”
groaned Agnes, to herself. “But why did he
come back again that night, if it wasn’t for the
album?”
</p>
<p>
She had to admit that Neale must have been the
midnight visitor to the dining room. There was
no other explanation of <em>that</em> incident.
</p>
<p>
Neale had not been to church on Sunday, but
she had seen him at school on this day, for he was
in her grade; but he had not spoken to her or even
looked at her.
</p>
<p>
Agnes was hurt to the quick by this. She felt
that Ruth had been unkind to Neale; but on her
part she was sure she was guilty of no unfriendliness.
</p>
<p>
“He needn’t spit it out on <em>me</em>,” was the way
Agnes inelegantly expressed it. “And why did
he want to come over here and play burglar Saturday
night? And goodness! what did he want in
that closet in the dining room chimney?
</p>
<p>
“He surely wouldn’t want Aunt Sarah’s peppermints,”
she giggled. “And what else is there
in that cupboard?”
</p>
<p>
The thought sent Agnes marching into the dining room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
to look at the locked door. And there
stood Barnabetta Scruggs!
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta was at the door of the closet in the
chimney. She did not appear to hear Agnes come
into the room. She was closely examining the
lock on the closet door.
</p>
<p>
“What under the sun is <em>she</em> after?” thought
Agnes. “What’s that in her hand? A pair of
shears?”
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta raised the shears just as though she
contemplated trying to pick the lock with them.
She laid hold upon the knob and shook the door.
</p>
<p>
“For pity’s sake, Barnabetta!” exclaimed
Agnes. “What do you want there?”
</p>
<p>
The circus girl jumped and actually screamed.
Her thin face flushed and then paled. Her eyes
flashed.
</p>
<p>
“I might ha’ known ’twas <em>you</em>—always snoopin’
around!” snarled Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why—”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t I look at that old lock if I want to?
I’m not hurtin’ it.”
</p>
<p>
“And I’m pretty sure you can’t unlock it with
those shears,” returned the wondering Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Who’s trying to unlock it?” snapped Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“You were.”
</p>
<p>
“Weren’t, neither!” declared the circus girl,
throwing down the shears. “Leastways, not for
myself,” she added.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know what it is you want out of
that closet—what anybody wants there,” Agnes
said, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“Your auntie wants some more peppermints,”
said Barnabetta, boldly. “She couldn’t unlock
it with the key. I didn’t know but the lock could
be picked.”
</p>
<p>
“Where’s the key?” asked Agnes, swiftly.
</p>
<p>
“Your auntie took it away with her again.”
</p>
<p>
Agnes stared at her in amazement. She believed
Barnabetta must be telling an untruth.
“I’m going to find out what’s in that closet—that’s
what I am going to do,” she declared.
</p>
<p>
She marched out of the room. She heard Barnabetta
laugh unpleasantly as she closed the
door. Agnes went up to Aunt Sarah’s room.
</p>
<p>
“Aunt Sarah,” Agnes said earnestly, “won’t
you let me have the key of the dining room closet?
I want to get something out of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Good Land of Liberty!” exclaimed Aunt
Sarah, with asperity. “You’re welcome to that
old key, I’m sure. I dunno why I brought it up
here again. Ye can’t unlock it, gal. I declare!
I was an old silly to lock the door the other night.
Now the lock’s fouled and ye can’t turn the key
neither-which-way!”
</p>
<p>
She took the big brass key out of her bag and
handed it to the amazed Agnes. Agnes was
amazed because she had discovered that Barnabetta
had told the truth about it!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—BARNABETTA CONFESSES</h2>
<p>
When Agnes reached the dining room again,
the circus girl was gone. She tried the key in the
lock of the cupboard door. Just as Aunt Sarah
Maltby said, it would not turn. Something had
fouled the lock.
</p>
<p>
“I do declare!” thought the troubled and perplexed
Agnes. “This is the strangest thing. I
never did want to get into this old cupboard before;
but I feel now as though I’d just <em>got</em> to.
</p>
<p>
“There surely is something in it besides Aunt
Sarah’s peppermints. Barnabetta told the truth
about Aunt Sarah; but she had a personal reason
for wanting to open the door, too. I’m certain
of <em>that</em>. Dear me! What is this mystery? I
want to know.”
</p>
<p>
She did not see how she could pick the lock
of the closet door herself. She knew nothing
about such work. Agnes wished Neale were
friendly with them so that she could ask him.
</p>
<p>
And then immediately she was smitten with the
thought that Neale O’Neil was another person
who seemed curious about what was in the closet.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” murmured Agnes. “What a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
terrible mix-up this is. What ever shall I do
about it?”
</p>
<p>
Her greatest desire, next to being friends with
Neale O’Neil again, was to take Ruth into <em>her</em>
confidence about her adventure Saturday night
with the mysterious burglar. But because suspicion
must point directly to Neale, she could not
bring herself to talk it over with her sister.
</p>
<p>
And Ruth, fearing to take anybody into her
confidence regarding the real ownership of the
lost treasure, was passing through a sea of
troubled waters without even Agnes to confess to.
The oldest Corner House girl was, at this very
moment, sitting in her room trying to compose a
letter to Mr. Howbridge that should reveal the
whole story. She supposed the lawyer’s clerk
would know how to reach him, for Ruth had forgotten
that Tiverton was the name of the town
to which Mr. Howbridge had been called by his
brother’s illness.
</p>
<p>
With her pen poised over the page of her letter
she wondered how she should word her confession
to Mr. Howbridge. For Ruth felt that
she, herself, was much to blame for the final loss
of the treasure.
</p>
<p>
Although she blamed Neale to her sister, in her
heart Ruth knew that had she been wiser in the
first place, all this mystery and difficulty following
the odd find in the Corner House garret, would
never have arisen.
</p>
<p>
If she had done one of two things, right then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
and there, she saw now that the album would never
have gone out of her custody.
</p>
<p>
She should either have taken Agnes and Neale
into her confidence and shown them the book, and
told them she had extracted one of the ten dollar
bills to show to Mr. Crouch at the bank; or she
should have locked the old album away in a perfectly
safe place until the value of the paper
could be determined.
</p>
<p>
It is only human nature to look for some scapegoat
for our sins. Knowing herself to have neglected
proper precautions, it was quite natural
that Ruth should blame Neale. But <em>now</em> she
blamed herself. Poor Mrs. Eland! And poor
Miss Pepperill! In her heart of hearts Ruth had
longed to do something worth while to help the
two unfortunate ladies. And all the time a fortune
belonging to them was hid away in the garret
of the old Corner House.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” she moaned, sitting over her
unfinished letter. “Why should they be punished
for my neglect? It is not fair!”
</p>
<p>
She heard a door open, and then voices. The
sound was right on this floor.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you we’ve <em>got</em> to go, Pop. Well slip
out of the side door and nobody will notice us.
It’s gettin’ dark,” said an anxious young voice.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see why we got to go, Barney,” responded
a querulous voice.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you we can’t stay here another minute.
Seems to me I shall die if we do!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
</p>
<p>
Ruth sprang up and ran softly to the door of
her room. Asa Scruggs’ complaining voice retorted:
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what’s got inter ye, Barney.
You know I can’t hobble a block. These folks is
mighty kind. We ain’t got a right to treat ’em
so.”
</p>
<p>
“We’re treatin’ ’em better by goin’ away than
by stayin’,” declared the other voice. “I tell
you, Pop, we’ve got to go!”
</p>
<p>
Ruth opened her door. A lithe, boyish figure
was aiding the limping clown along the passage
toward the back stairway. But the face the
strange figure turned to Ruth was that of Barnabetta
Scruggs.
</p>
<p>
“Why! Why, Barnabetta!” gasped the Corner
House girl in vast amazement.
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta was dumb. The weak mouth of the
old circus clown trembled, and his eyes blinked,
as he stood there on one foot, and stared, speechless,
at their hostess.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Barnabetta!” cried Ruth again.
“What ever is the matter?”
</p>
<p>
“We’re goin’,” said the circus girl, sullenly.
</p>
<p>
“Going where?”
</p>
<p>
“Well! we’re not goin’ to stay <em>here</em>,” said Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Barnabetta! Why not?”
</p>
<p>
“We’re not—that’s all,” ejaculated the trapeze
artist.
</p>
<p>
“But I am sure your father isn’t fit to leave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
the house,” Ruth said. “Surely, you know
you are welcome to remain till he is quite
well.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got no business here. We never ought
to’ve come,” said Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“Why not? You make us no trouble. I am
sure you have been treated kindly.”
</p>
<p>
“What for?” snapped Barnabetta. “You
folks have got no call to treat us kind. We’re
nothin’ to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Barnabetta! I thought we were friends,”
the Corner House girl said, really grieved by
this. “I would not keep you a moment longer
than you wish to stay; but I hope you understand
that you and Mr. Scruggs are perfectly welcome
here.
</p>
<p>
“And I don’t want you to go away in those
boy’s clothes, Barnabetta. You tell me your other
clothing is all in your trunk at the express office
in Tiverton. Why not send for it? But the frock
and other things I let you have, I meant for you to
keep.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want ’em,” said Barnabetta, ungratefully.
“If we’ve got to tramp it, I can’t be bothered
with skirts.”
</p>
<p>
“But my <em>dear</em>!” cried Ruth, desperately, “your
father can’t walk. Of course he can’t!”
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to get down South where we can
get a job with some tent show,” Barnabetta declared,
deaf to Ruth’s objections.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Scruggs! You know you can’t get there,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
Ruth cried. “And if you really <em>must</em> go, Barnabetta—”
</p>
<p>
“I can get a job, anyway,” said the girl.
</p>
<p>
“Then let me help you on your way. Where
do you want to go? Maybe I can pay your fare
and you can pay me back when—when you have
luck again.”
</p>
<p>
“Hear that, Barney?” gasped Asa Scruggs.
“She’s right. I can’t walk yet.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not goin’ to take money from these girls!”
</p>
<p>
“Only as a loan?” begged Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Aw—we’ll never get so we could pay you
back,” groaned Barnabetta, hopelessly. “We’re
in bad, and that’s all there is to it.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Scruggs leaned against the wall and looked
at Ruth timidly. Evidently he had been all
through the argument with his stubborn daughter
already.
</p>
<p>
“I cannot understand you, Barnabetta,” said
Ruth, sadly. “For your father’s sake—at least,
let him stay with us till his ankle is better.”
</p>
<p>
“He can stay,” said Barnabetta, quickly. “If
he will.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ve never been separated yet, miss,” Asa
Scruggs said to Ruth, excusingly. “Not since her
mother left her to me—a baby in arms.
</p>
<p>
“Barnabetta was brought up in the circus. I
cradled her in my make-up tray, and she slept
there, or sucked at her bottle, when I was out in
the ring doin’ my turn as a joey.
</p>
<p>
“She ain’t had much experience outside the big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
top. She couldn’t be sure of gettin’ a safe job—only
a young gal like her—lest I was with her.”
</p>
<p>
“Why!” exclaimed Ruth, more cheerfully.
“Let her wait here—with you—Mr. Scruggs.
Maybe we can find her a job right here in Milton,
until your ankle is well enough for you to travel.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” snorted Barnabetta. “Who wants a
lady acrobat, I’d like to know, in this ‘hick’
burg?”
</p>
<p>
“But, can’t you do anything else, Barnabetta?”
asked Ruth, more eagerly. “Couldn’t you ‘tend
counter in a candy store like June Wildwood? Or
maybe we could get you a chance in the Five
and Ten Cent Store. Oh! as soon as Mr. Howbridge
gets home, I am sure he can help us.”
</p>
<p>
“We’re not a-goin’ to stay,” interrupted Barnabetta,
still bitterly antagonistic to every suggestion
of the Corner House girl. “Come on,
Pop.”
</p>
<p>
“Aw, Barney! Listen to reason,” begged the
clown.
</p>
<p>
“We haven’t got a right to,” gasped Barnabetta.
“I tell you these girls will want to put us
in jail.”
</p>
<p>
“What for?” demanded Ruth, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
“Well <em>me</em> in jail, then. Pop hasn’t done anything.”’
</p>
<p>
“But, for pity’s sake, what for?”
</p>
<p>
“If you knew what I was—what I did—”
</p>
<p>
“What did you do, Barnabetta?” queried Ruth,
with some excitement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p>
“I—I stole that old book you’re huntin’ for.
It was me took it out of Neale Sorber’s bag.
That’s what!”
</p>
<p>
The confession burst from Barnabetta wildly.
</p>
<p>
“I knew there was money in it. I saw it when
he was up to the winter quarters of the circus at
Tiverton. That other girl knew I saw it. Hasn’t
she told you?”
</p>
<p>
“Who—Aggie?” asked the amazed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. <em>She</em> knows what I am—a thief!”
</p>
<p>
“No! Oh, no, Barnabetta! Don’t call yourself
that. And Agnes never said a word to me
against you. Agnes likes you.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see how she can. She knew I wanted
to steal the book. She must have guessed I got it
out of Neale’s bag Saturday night. And I guess
now she knows what I did with it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Barnabetta! What <em>did</em> you do with it?”
cried Ruth, forgetting everything else but the sudden
hope that the album might be recovered.
</p>
<p>
“I put it in the bottom of that closet downstairs
in the dinin’ room,” confessed Barnabetta, bursting
into tears. “And your auntie locked the door
and I couldn’t get at it again. And now she
can’t unlock it.
</p>
<p>
“I—I was hopin’ I could get the book and give
it back to you—leave it somewhere where you’d
be sure to see it. I was ashamed of what I’d
done. I wouldn’t touch a dollar of that money in
it—not now, after you’d been so awful nice to me
and Pop. And—and—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
</p>
<p>
But here Ruth put both arms around her and
stopped her lips with a kiss.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Barnabetta! Don’t say another word!”
she cried. “You have made me the happiest girl
in all the world to-day!”
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta stared at her, open-mouthed and
wide-eyed.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that you’re sayin’, Miss Ruth?” asked
the clown.
</p>
<p>
“Why, don’t you <em>see</em>?” cried Ruth, laughing
and sobbing together. “I thought the book was
really lost—that we’d never recover it. And I’ve
just discovered that all that money and those
bonds in it belong to our dear friend, Mrs. Eland,
and her sister, who is in the hospital. Oh! and
they need the money so badly!
</p>
<p>
“Just think! it is a fortune. There’s fifty thousand
dollars in money besides the bonds. And
I took one of the notes to the bank and found
out for sure that the money is good.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” cried Ruth, in conclusion, sobbing
and laughing together until she hiccoughed.
“Oh, dear me! I never was so delighted by anything
in my life—not even when we came here to
live at the old Corner House!”
</p>
<p>
“But—but—isn’t the money yours, Ruth?”
asked Barnabetta. “Doesn’t it belong to you
Corner House girls?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no. It was money left by Mr. Lemuel
Aden when he died. I am sure of that. And
Mrs. Eland and Miss Pepperill are his nieces.”

<span class='caption'>“You’ll break it!” gasped Agnes. “That’s<br/>what I mean to do” said Ruth.</span>
</div>
<p>
“Then it doesn’t mean anything to <em>you</em> if the
money is found?” gasped the circus girl.
</p>
<p>
“Of course it means something to me—to us
all. Of course it does, Barnabetta. I never can
thank you enough for telling me—”
</p>
<p>
“But I stole it first and put it there,” said Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind! Don’t worry about that. Let
us run down and get the book out of the closet.
And don’t <em>dare</em> leave this house, either of you!”
she commanded, running down the back stairs.
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta helped her father back to his room.
Then she went down the front flight and met the
excited Ruth and the quite amazed Agnes in the
dining room. Ruth had the heavy kitchen poker.
</p>
<p>
“What under the sun are you going to do with
that poker, Ruth Kenway?” demanded Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Aggie! Think of it! That old album is
locked in that closet.”
</p>
<p>
“Well! didn’t I just begin to believe so myself?”
ejaculated the second Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
Ruth waited for no further explanation. She
pressed the heavy poker into the aperture between
the lock of the door and the striker, pushing
as hard as she could, and then used the strong
poker as a prize. The door creaked.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll break it!” gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I mean to do. We can’t unlock
it,” said Ruth, with determination.
</p>
<p>
The next moment, with a splintering of wood,
the lock gave and the door swung open. Ruth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
flung down the poker and dived into the bottom
of the closet.
</p>
<p>
Up she came with her prize. Unmistakably it
was the album Agnes had found in the garret.
</p>
<p>
“Hurrah!” shouted Agnes. “Oh, dear! I’m
so glad—”
</p>
<p>
But Ruth uttered a cry of despair. She had
brought the old volume to the table and opened
it. The yellowed and paste-stained pages were
bare!
</p>
<p>
Swiftly she fluttered the leaves from the front
to the back cover. Not a bond, not a banknote,
was left in the book. Everything of value had
been removed, and the girls, horror-stricken, realized
that the treasure was as far from their custody
as ever.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—WHO WAS THE ROBBER?</h2>
<p>
That was a terrible moment in the lives of the
two older Corner House girls.
</p>
<p>
Terrible for Ruth, because she saw crushed thus
unexpectedly her desire to make Mrs. Eland and
her sister happy and comfortable for life. Terrible
for Agnes, because she could think of nobody
but Neale O’Neil who could have got at the
album and abstracted the money and bonds.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear!” wailed Agnes,
and threw herself into a chair, despairingly.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was pallid. Barnabetta Scruggs stared at
the two Corner House girls with horrified, wide-open
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Now—<em>now</em>,” the circus girl muttered, “you
girls won’t ever believe a word I say!”
</p>
<p>
“Why not, Barnabetta?” asked Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I told your sister I put that album in the
closet—and I did. But I didn’t take even one
banknote out of the book!”
</p>
<p>
“I believe you, Barnabetta,” Ruth said faintly.
“But—but who is the robber?”
</p>
<p>
“I was enough of a thief to take the book out of
Neale’s bag,” said the circus girl. “But I didn’t
even look into it. I didn’t have time.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
</p>
<p>
“How did you come to do it?” asked Agnes,
curiously.
</p>
<p>
“I heard Neale when he came here Saturday
night. Of course, I knew ’twas him by his voice
and what you girls said. And I heard there was
some kind of a row.”
</p>
<p>
“There was,” sighed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I came down and listened at the door of that
other room where you girls and Neale were talkin’.
I heard him say the book was in his bag on the
porch, and I knew that bag didn’t have any lock
to it.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” groaned Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“I was goin’ to get it before he came out; but
he flung open the sittin’ room door so quick he
pretty near caught me. I crouched down in the
corner at the foot of the stairs and if he hadn’t
been so mad,” said Barnabetta, “he must have
seen me.
</p>
<p>
“But he didn’t, and when he was gone I went
outside and got the book. You girls were still in
the sittin’ room; but I heard somebody up in the
back hall and I was afraid to go upstairs, either
by the back or the front flight.
</p>
<p>
“So I slipped into the dinin’ room and there
was little Dottie. I kept the book behind me and
didn’t know what to do with it. But Dottie ran
out of the room and I plumped it into that closet
and shut the door quick,” finished Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“And is that all?” Ruth said, very much disappointed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
</p>
<p>
“I—I never saw the book again till just now.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” began Agnes, when the circus girl interrupted
her, jerkily.
</p>
<p>
“I—I tried to see it. I was goin’ to steal the
money—or, some of it, anyway. I know you’ll
think me awful. But—but we were so hard up,
and all—just the same, I couldn’t get into the
closet again.
</p>
<p>
“I staid awake Saturday night, and when I
thought everybody was abed and the house was
still, I came down here in this boy’s suit—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” cried Agnes again—and this time in a
much relieved tone. But Barnabetta did not notice.
</p>
<p>
“Your aunt came down with her candle for
those peppermints before I could get at the book.”
</p>
<p>
“But what did you do <em>then</em>?” asked the eager
and curious Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I was just about crazy,” admitted the circus
girl. “I thought I’d done that sin of stealin’ the
book and it had done us no good. I wanted to
run away right then and there—I’d have left poor
Pop behind.
</p>
<p>
“But when I got the porch door out there ready
to open, I heard your old dog snuffin’ outside,
and it scared me pretty near to death. I knew he
wouldn’t let me out—and I was afraid he’d bite
me if I let him in.
</p>
<p>
“So I ran upstairs and shut myself into that
room again. And I didn’t dare come out till
mornin’.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thank goodness!” gasped Agnes, under
her breath. “It wasn’t Neale O’Neil!”
</p>
<p>
But this did not explain the mystery of the disappearance
of the treasure trove that had been
found in the Corner House garret. The Kenway
girls were sure that Barnabetta Scruggs had told
them the truth. She was not to blame for the actual
robbery.
</p>
<p>
“And that must have occurred some time before
you came down to look for the book Saturday
night, Barnabetta,” Ruth said. “What time was
it?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, about midnight.”
</p>
<p>
“Then the robber got at the book some time in
the hour between half past ten and half past
eleven. Mrs. MacCall did not retire until half
past ten, that is sure.”
</p>
<p>
“But how did he get in, and how did he get out,
and who, for pity’s sake, <em>is</em> he?” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Ruth shook her head. She might have said that
her acquaintance among burglars was just as limited
as Agnes’ own.
</p>
<p>
Only, this was no occasion for humor. The loss
of a treasure amounting, possibly, to a hundred
thousand dollars was no subject for raillery.
</p>
<p>
“What will Mr. Howbridge say!” groaned
Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! Let’s not worry about what he
says!” cried Agnes. “It’s nothing to him.
Think of it! We are the losers of all that
money.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
</p>
<p>
“No,” Ruth said quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Why not? What do you mean?” demanded
her sister.
</p>
<p>
“It is a great loss, an irreparable loss, to the
real owners of the fortune.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, who are they?” demanded Agnes. “We
don’t know them. I suppose the courts would
have to decide. But I guess a part of the money,
anyway, would come to us. Enough to buy an
automobile.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” repeated Ruth, shaking her head.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” cried her sister. “Of course it’s
ours!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I say. But your sister wants to
give it all away,” said Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“Give it all away!” cried Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t ours—or, it <em>wasn’t</em> ours—to give,”
Ruth declared.
</p>
<p>
“I should say not!” ejaculated the puzzled
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“But I do know whom it belonged to,” said
Ruth, quietly.
</p>
<p>
“Not Aunt Sarah?” gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“No. Nobody at all here. It was hidden in
our garret by Lemuel Aden when he was here
the last time to see Uncle Peter.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness me!” cried Agnes. “Lemuel Aden?
That wicked old miser?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“But how do you know, Ruth Kenway? I
thought he died in a poorhouse?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
</p>
<p>
“He did. That was like the miser he was.”
</p>
<p>
“But, if he’s dead—?” But Agnes did not follow
the idea to its conclusion.
</p>
<p>
“Why, don’t you see,” Ruth hastened to say.
“The money belongs to Mr. Aden’s nieces—Mrs.
Eland and Miss Pepperill. And they need it so!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my goodness! so it does!”
</p>
<p>
“And we have lost it!” finished Ruth, in despair.
</p>
<p>
“Well! they can’t blame us,” Agnes said, swift
to be upon the defensive.
</p>
<p>
“But I blame myself. I should have taken more
care of the book, in the first place.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you don’t blame Neale?” demanded
Agnes, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“He’s to blame for carrying the book off without
saying anything about it to us,” said Ruth.
“But I am mainly at fault.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Barnabetta suddenly. “I’m to
blame. If I had left the book in the bag on the
porch, you girls would have found it all right, and
the money would not have been stolen.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see how you make that out,” Agnes
said. “If the robber found the book in that closet
where you hid it, why couldn’t he have found it
anywhere else in the house?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps not if I had locked it in the silver
safe in the pantry,” Ruth said slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well! what does it matter who’s at fault?”
Agnes demanded, impatiently. “The money’s
gone.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it’s gone,” repeated her sister. “And
poor Mrs. Eland and Miss Pepperill, who need it
so much, will never see it.”
</p>
<p>
“You girls worry a lot over other folks’
troubles,” said Barnabetta. “And those women
you tell about don’t even know that their grandfather
left the money, do they?”
</p>
<p>
“Their uncle,” corrected Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Of course not,” said Agnes, in reply to Barnabetta,
and quite subdued now by Ruth’s revelation
regarding the probable owners of the fortune.
“But, you see, Barnabetta, they are our friends;
and we wanted very much to help them, anyway.”
</p>
<p>
“And it did seem as though Providence must
have sent us to that corner of the garret that evening,
just so Agnes should find the old album,”
added Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“But I wish I hadn’t found it!” wailed Agnes,
suddenly. “Just see the trouble we’re in.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I guess ’twasn’t providential your goin’
there, was it?” demanded Barnabetta.
</p>
<p>
“We can’t say that,” responded Ruth, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“You Corner House girls are the greatest!”
burst out the trapeze performer. “I never saw
anybody like you! Do you spend all your time
tryin’ to help other folks?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—we help when we can and where we
can,” Ruth said.
</p>
<p>
“It’s lots of fun, too,” put in Agnes. “It’s
nice to make friends.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why—I believe it must be,” sighed Barnabetta.
“But I never thought of it—just so. I
never saw folks like you Corner House girls before.
That’s what made me feel so mean when
I had robbed you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t let’s talk any more about <em>that</em>,”
Ruth said, with her old kindness of tone and manner.
“We’ll forget it.”
</p>
<p>
But Barnabetta said, seriously: “I never can.
Don’t think it! I’m goin’ to remember it all the
days of my life. And I <em>know</em> it’s my fault that
you’ve lost all the money.”
</p>
<p>
Ruth returned the poker to its place, and Agnes
swept up the chips of wood and the bits of the
broken lock. Ruth carefully put away the big old
book Agnes had found in the garret.
</p>
<p>
“Locking the barn after the horse is stolen,”
commented Agnes.
</p>
<p>
Ruth felt that she could not finish that letter
to Mr. Howbridge. There was no haste about
it. She could wait to tell him all about the catastrophe
when he returned to Milton. Advice now
was of no value to her. The fortune was gone.
Indeed, she shrank from talking about it any more.
Talk would not bring the treasure back, that was
sure.
</p>
<p>
She had not Agnes’ overpowering curiosity.
There was a sort of dumb ache at Ruth’s heart,
and she sighed whenever she remembered poor
Mrs. Eland and her sister.
</p>
<p>
If Dr. Forsyth was to be believed, a long, long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
rest was Miss Pepperill’s only cure. News from
the State Hospital had assured the friends of the
unfortunate school teacher that she would soon be
at liberty.
</p>
<p>
But she might then lapse into a morose and unfortunate
state of mind, unless she could rest,
have a surcease of worry, and a change of scene.
How could poor Mrs. Eland leave her position to
care for her sister? And how could either of
them go away for a year or two to rest, with their
small means?
</p>
<p>
It was, indeed, a very unfortunate condition of
affairs. That the hospital matron knew nothing
as yet about the fortune which should be her own
and her sister’s, made it no better in Ruth’s opinion.
</p>
<p>
The more volatile Agnes could not be expected
to feel so deeply the misfortune that had overtaken
them. Besides, Agnes had one certain reason
for being put in a happier frame of mind by
the discovery they had just made.
</p>
<p>
The cloud of suspicion that had been raised in
her thoughts by circumstantial evidence, no longer
rested upon Neale O’Neil. If Neale would only
“get over his mad fit,” as Agnes expressed it, she
thought she would be quite happy once more.
</p>
<p>
For never having possessed a hundred thousand
dollars in fact, Agnes Kenway was not likely to
weep much over its loss. The vast sum of money
had really been nothing tangible to her.
</p>
<p>
Only for an hour or so after Ruth had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
to the bank the second time and made sure that
the money in the old album was legal tender, had
Agnes really been convinced of its value. Then
her thought had flown immediately to the possibility
of their buying the long-wished-for automobile.
</p>
<p>
But the tempting possibility had no more than
risen above the horizon of her mind than it had
been eclipsed by the horrid discovery that a robber
had relieved them of the treasure trove.
</p>
<p>
“So, that’s all there is to <em>that</em>!” sighed Agnes
to herself. “I guess the Corner House family
won’t ride in a car yet awhile.”
</p>
<p>
When Ruth had spoken about Mrs. Eland and
her sister, however, saying that the money really
belonged to them, this thought finally gained a
place in Agnes’ mind, too. She was not at all a
selfish girl, and she began to think that perhaps
an automobile would not have been forthcoming
after all.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! what a little beast I am,” she told
herself in secret. “To think only of our own
pleasure. Maybe, if the money hadn’t been lost,
Mrs. Eland would have given us enough out of it
to buy the car. But just see what good could
have come to poor Miss Pepperill and Mrs. Eland
if the money had reached their hands.
</p>
<p>
“Mercy me!” pursued the next-to-the-oldest
Corner House girl. “If I ever find a battered ten
cent piece again, I’ll believe it’s good until it’s
proved to be lead. Just think! If I’d only had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
faith in that money in the old book being good,
I’d have shouted loud enough to wake up the
whole household, and surely somebody—Mrs.
MacCall, or Ruth—would have kept me from letting
poor Neale take the book away.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Neale!” she sighed again. “It wasn’t
his fault. He didn’t believe that paper was any
good—and those bonds. Of course he didn’t. I—I
wonder if he showed the bonds and money to
anybody at all?”
</p>
<p>
This thought was rather a startling one. Her
boy friend had taken the old album away from
the Corner House in the first place with the
avowed purpose of showing the bonds to somebody
who would know about such things.
</p>
<p>
Of course, he did not show them to Mr. Con
Murphy, the cobbler. And it did not seem as
though he had had time on Christmas morning to
show the book to anybody else before he went to
Tiverton.
</p>
<p>
Nor would he have taken the book away if he
had been decided, one way or the other, about the
bonds and money. Had he shown them to any
person while in Tiverton?
</p>
<p>
If so, Agnes suddenly wished to know who that
person was. If Barnabetta Scruggs could get into
Neale’s room at the winter quarters of Twomley &amp;
Sorber’s Herculean Circus and Menagerie, and
could take a peep at the contents of the big book
the boy carried in his bag, why could not some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
other—and some more evil-disposed person—have
done the same?
</p>
<p>
Ruth had suggested it. She had said that a
robber might have followed Neale O’Neil all the
way from the circus and stolen the book off the
porch of the old Corner House.
</p>
<p>
The same possibility held good regarding the
removal of the money and the bonds from the book
after Barnabetta had hidden it in the dining room
closet. At that very moment the robber might
have been in the house and seen what Barnabetta
did with the book.
</p>
<p>
Of course, that was the explanation! Some
hanger-on of the circus had followed Neale home
to rob him—and had succeeded.
</p>
<p>
But, beyond that thought, and carrying the idea
to its logical conclusion, Agnes pondered that
Neale might have noticed that he was followed to
Milton, and might know who the person was.
</p>
<p>
With Neale to suggest the identity of this robber,
it might be possible to secure his person and
recover the money. That idea no sooner took possession
of Agnes Kenway’s mind than she started
up, ready and eager to do something to prove the
thought correct.
</p>
<p>
“And I’ll see Neale first of all. It all lies with
him,” she said aloud. “He’s got to help us. I
don’t care if he <em>is</em> mad. He’s just got to get over
his mad and tell us how we shall go about finding
the robber!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—NEALE O’NEIL FLINGS A BOMB</h2>
<p>
Agnes came to her decision to interview Neale
O’Neil just before the family dinner hour. She
had to wait until after the meal before putting it
into execution.
</p>
<p>
Ordinarily Neale would have been over at the
old Corner House soon after seven o’clock with
his books, ready to join the girls at their studies in
the sitting room. He was not to be expected now,
however. Only the little girls mentioned Neale’s
absence.
</p>
<p>
“I guess something has happened since Neale
came home from the circus,” Dot observed. “He
don’t seem to like us any more.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure we’ve done nothing to him,” said
Tess, quite troubled. “But, anyway, you can’t
ever tell anything about boys—what they’ll do.
Can you, Ruthie?”
</p>
<p>
“There spoke the oracle,” giggled Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Tess is a budding suffragette,” commented
Mrs. MacCall.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my! You sure won’t be one of those awful
suffering-etts when you grow up, will you,
Tessie?” cried the horror-stricken Dot.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! <em>Suffragette</em>, Dot!” admonished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
her sister. “But—but I guess I don’t want to
be one. They say Miss Grimsby is one and I’m
sure I don’t want to be anything she is.”
</p>
<p>
“Is she very—very awful?” asked Dot, pityingly,
yet with curiosity.
</p>
<p>
“She is awfully hard to get along with,” admitted
Tess. “Sometimes Miss Pepperill was
cross; but Miss Grimsby is mad all the time.”
</p>
<p>
“I—I wish they’d take Mabel Creamer into
your room and let you take her place in mine,”
Dot said, feeling that her enemy next door should
be put under the eye of just such a stern teacher
as Miss Grimsby.
</p>
<p>
“I s’pose she’ll make faces at me to-morrow,”
pursued Dot, with a sigh. “And she <em>can</em> make
awful faces, you know she can, Tessie.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, faces won’t ever hurt you,” the other
sister said, philosophically.
</p>
<p>
“No-o,” rejoined Dot. “Not really, of course.
But,” she confessed, “it makes you want to make
faces, too. And I can’t wriggle my face all up
like Mabel Creamer can!”
</p>
<p>
Now, clothed in a proper frock again, Barnabetta
Scruggs made one at the dinner table. She
was subdued and rather silent; but as always she
was kind to the children, beside whom she sat; and
she was really grateful now to Ruth.
</p>
<p>
Despite her rough exterior, Barnabetta was kind
at heart. She had only been hiding her good
qualities from Ruth and Agnes because she knew
in her heart that she meant to injure them. Now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
that she had confessed her wrong doing, her hardness
of manner and foolish pride were all melted
down. And nobody could long resist the sweetness
of Ruth and the jollity of Agnes.
</p>
<p>
The latter slipped away right after dinner,
leaving the little girls listening to one of Barnabetta’s
fairy stories—this time about The Horse
That Made a House for the Birds.
</p>
<p>
“That circus girl is a good deal like a singed
cat,” remarked Mrs. MacCall in the kitchen.
“I’m free to confess I didn’t think much of her at
first. You and Ruth do pick up some crooked
sticks.” She spoke to Agnes who was preparing
to go out.
</p>
<p>
“But I watched her with the little ones and—bless
her heart!—she’s a real little woman!
Working in a circus all her life hasn’t spoiled
her; but it isn’t a business that I’d want a daughter
of mine to follow.
</p>
<p>
“And there isn’t a mite of harm in that Asa
Scruggs,” added the housekeeper. “Only I never
did see such a melancholy looking man. And he
a clown!”
</p>
<p>
Agnes was thinking how strange it was she
should have met Barnabetta and her father in the
woods and brought them home, when they had
come from the Twomley &amp; Sorber Circus, and
knew Neale O’Neil. And what would Neale say
when he learned that the clown and his daughter
were at the old Corner House?
</p>
<p>
Agnes remembered quite clearly that Neale had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
caught Barnabetta looking at the book of money
while he had it in his possession at the winter
quarters of the circus. At once the boy would connect
the robbery of the Corner House with the circus
girl’s presence there.
</p>
<p>
And that would never do. For Agnes was positive
that Barnabetta was guiltless of the final
disappearance of the treasure trove.
</p>
<p>
But suppose Neale was convinced otherwise?
With sorrow the Corner House girl had to admit
that her boy friend could be “awful stubborn” if
he so chose.
</p>
<p>
“And he might come right over here and say
something cross to Barnabetta and to poor Mr.
Scruggs, and then everybody’d be unhappy,”
Agnes told herself. “Barnabetta is repentant for
all she did. It would be mean to accuse her of
something she hadn’t done at all.”
</p>
<p>
So Agnes went rather soberly down the back
yard paths to the end of the chicken run. She
never contemplated for an instant going round by
Willow Street and Willow Wythe to reach the cobbler’s
front door.
</p>
<p>
Only a high board fence separated the Corner
House premises from the little back yard of Mr.
Con Murphy. There was the corner where Neale
got over, and Agnes was enough of a tomboy to
know the most approved fashion of mounting the
barrier.
</p>
<p>
But she hesitated a moment before she did this.
Maybe Neale was not there. Maybe he was still so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
angry that he would not see her if she went into
Con’s little shop. She must cajole him.
</p>
<p>
Therefore she sent a tentative call over the back
fence:
</p>
<p>
“Oh-ee! Oh-ee! Oh-ee!”
</p>
<p>
She waited half a minute and repeated it. But
there was no answer.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” thought Agnes. “Is he still
huffy? Or isn’t he home?”
</p>
<p>
She ventured a third call, but to no avail.
Agnes, however, had a determined spirit. She
felt that Neale might help them in the emergency
which had arisen, and she proposed to get his help
in some fashion.
</p>
<p>
So she started to climb the fence. Just as she
did so—spang! A snowball burst right beside her
head. She was showered with snow and, screeching,
let go her hold and fell back into the Corner
House yard.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! oh! oh! Who was that?” sputtered
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
She glanced around under the bare-limbed trees
and tried to peer into the shadows cast by the hen
house and Billy Bumps’ abode. Not a soul there,
she was sure.
</p>
<p>
“Some boy going by on the street must have
thrown it,” Agnes thought. “But how could he
see me away in here?”
</p>
<p>
She essayed to climb the fence again, and a second
snowball—not quite as hard as the first—struck
her right between the shoulder blades.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! you horrid thing!” exclaimed Agnes, turning
to run toward the street fence. “I’d like to
get my hands on you! I bet if Neale were here you
wouldn’t fling snowballs at a girl!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t blow too much about what Neale O’Neil
would do!” cried a voice; and a figure appeared
at the corner of the hen house.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! you horrid thing! Neale O’Neil! You
flung those snowballs yourself!” gasped Agnes.
</p>
<p>
She was plucky and she started for him instantly,
grabbing a good-sized handful of snow as
she did so. Neale uttered a shout and turned to
run; but he caught his heel in something and went
over backward into the drift he himself had piled
up at the hen house door when he had shoveled the
path.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got you—you scamp!” declared the Corner
House girl, and fell upon him with the snowball
and rubbed his face well with it. Neale
actually squealed for mercy.
</p>
<p>
“Lemme up!”
</p>
<p>
“Got enough?”
</p>
<p>
“Yep!”
</p>
<p>
“Say ‘enough,’ then,” ordered Agnes, cramming
some more snow down the victim’s neck.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t—it tickles my tongue. Ouch! Look
out! Your turn will come yet, miss.”
</p>
<p>
“Do anything I say if I let you up?” demanded
Agnes, who had half buried Neale by her own
weight in the soft snow.
</p>
<p>
“Yep! Ouch! Don’t! Play fair!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then you’ll come right into the house and talk
to me and Ruthie about that awful money?” demanded
Agnes, getting up.
</p>
<p>
Neale started to rise, and then sat back in the
snow.
</p>
<p>
“What money?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“The money and bonds that were stuck into the
old album.”
</p>
<p>
“What about them?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! Oh, Neale!” cried Agnes, on the
verge of tears. “The money is gone.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh?”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t in the book! We—we never looked till
to-night, and—what do you think? Somebody got
into the house and robbed us—of all that money!
And it belonged to Mrs. Eland and her sister. Mr.
Lemuel Aden hid it in our garret. Now! isn’t that
awful?”
</p>
<p>
For a minute Neale made no reply. Agnes
thought he must be struck actually dumb by the
horror and surprise which the announcement
caused him. Then he made a funny noise and got
up out of the snow. His face was in the shadow.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with you?” demanded
Agnes.“Didn’t you hear?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes—I heard,” said Neale, in a peculiar tone.
“What did you say about that stuff in the book?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Neale! it is good. At least, the money
is. Ruth went again to the bank and she is <em>sure</em>
she had the right banknote examined this time.
And, of course, if one was good the rest were!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ye-es,” said Neale, still speaking oddly. “But
what about Mrs. Eland?”
</p>
<p>
“It belonged to her—all that money—and her
sister. You see, Lemuel Aden stayed here at the
old Corner House just before he died and he left
this book here because he believed it would be safe.
He said Uncle Peter was a fool, but honest. Horrid
old thing!”
</p>
<p>
“Who—Uncle Peter?” asked Neale.
</p>
<p>
“No—Lemuel Aden. And then he went and
died and never said anything about the money only
in his diary, and Mrs. Eland showed it to Ruth in
the diary, and Ruth knew what it meant, but she
didn’t tell Mrs. Eland. And now, Neale O’Neil,
somebody’s followed you down from that Tiverton
place, knowing you had that book, and got into our
house and taken all that money—”
</p>
<p>
“Gee, Aggie!” cried the boy, interrupting the
stream of this monologue. “You’ll lose your
breath talking so much. Let’s go in and see about
this.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale! Will you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I was coming to call you out anyway,”
said the boy, gruffly. “You’re a good kid, Aggie.
But Ruth can be too fresh—”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know how worried she’s been—how
worried we’ve both been,” Agnes said.
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right. But I’m honest. I wouldn’t
have stolen that money.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not, Neale,” cried Agnes, but secretly
condemned because there had been a time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
when, for a few hours, she herself had almost
doubted the honesty of the white-haired boy.
</p>
<p>
“But somebody must have seen it in your possession,
and come down with you and stolen it.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! You think so?”
</p>
<p>
“How else can you explain it?” demanded the
voluble Agnes, the pent up waters of her imagination
overflowing now. “Of course it was very
dangerous indeed for you to be carrying all that
wealth around with you. Why, Neale! you might
have been killed for it.
</p>
<p>
“The—the book was put in that old closet in the
dining room chimney. And Aunt Sarah locked the
door, not knowing there was anything of importance
in the closet but her peppermints. And then
we couldn’t unlock it because the lock was fouled.
</p>
<p>
“And so, we don’t know when the money was
taken. But we broke the lock of the closet this
afternoon and there it was—the book, I mean—empty!”
</p>
<p>
Neale was leading her toward the house. “Great
Peter’s pipe!” he gasped. “You can talk nineteen
to the dozen and no mistake, Aggie. Hush,
will you, till we get inside?”
</p>
<p>
Agnes was rather offended at this. She went up
the porch steps ahead and opened the door into the
hall. Ruth was just going into the sitting room.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Ruthie! are you alone?” whispered Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness! how you startled me,” said the
older sister. “There’s nobody in the sitting room.
What do you want? Oh!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s Neale,” said Agnes, dragging the boy in.
“And you’ve got to tell him how sorry you are for
what you said!”
</p>
<p>
“Well—I like that!” exclaimed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“You know you’re sorry,” pleaded the peacemaker.
“Say so!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I am! Come in, Neale O’Neil. Between
us, you and I have made an awful mess of this
thing. Mrs. Eland and Miss Pepperill have lost
all their fortune.”
</p>
<p>
“How’s that?” asked the boy, easily.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t Agnes tell you that the money and
bonds have been stolen?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—she said so,” admitted Neale.
</p>
<p>
“Well!” exclaimed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Well!” exclaimed Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I guess you are worried about not much of anything,”
said Neale O’Neil, lightly.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean, you silly boy?” demanded
Ruth, with rising asperity. “I tell you that money
must have all been good money, whether the bonds
were valuable or not.”
</p>
<p>
It was then Neale’s turn to say, “Well?”
</p>
<p>
“Neale O’Neil!” shouted Agnes, shaking him.
“What are you trying to do—torment us to death?
What do you know about this?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, I told you the old book was in my bag
on the porch when I left here Saturday night,”
drawled the boy. “But do you suppose I would
have flung it down there so carelessly if the money
and bonds had been in it?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Neale! Oh, Ruth! I’m going to faint!”
murmured Agnes Kenway, and she sank into a
chair and began to “stiffen out” in approved
fainting fashion.
</p>
<p>
But when she saw the boy pick up a vase, grab
the flowers out of it with ruthless hand, and start
to douse her with the water it was supposed to contain,
the Corner House girl “came to” very
promptly.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t do that!” she cried. “You’ll spoil those
roses. And if there was water in that vase it
would ruin my dress. Goosey! Those are artificial
flowers, anyway. That’s all a boy knows!”
</p>
<p>
“Neale seems to know a great deal that we do
not,” Ruth said faintly, really more overcome than
Agnes was by the bomb Neale had flung.
</p>
<p>
“Say! haven’t you heard from Mr. Howbridge?”
demanded the youth.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Howbridge?” murmured Ruth. “No.”
</p>
<p>
“Then he’ll be home himself to-morrow, and
thought it wasn’t worth while to write.”
</p>
<p>
“What <em>do</em> you mean, Neale O’Neil?” demanded
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Did <em>you</em> see Mr. Howbridge?” asked Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“Sure!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
</p>
<p>
“But I thought you went to see your uncle,
Mr. Sorber,” said the oldest Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
“So I did. Poor Uncle Bill! He was pretty
well done up. But he’s better now, as I told you.
But that’s why I took the old book with me.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>What</em> is <em>why</em>?” demanded Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“Such ‘langwitch’!” exclaimed Neale, with
laughter. “I tell you I carried that album away
with me because I wanted to show the stuff in it to
Mr. Howbridge. I remembered he was up there in
Tiverton, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me! I had forgotten it!” cried Ruth.
</p>
<p>
“I remembered, but I forgot to tell you,” said
Agnes.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t think the stuff was any good. But I
thought Mr. Howbridge ought to see it and judge
for himself. So I took it to him. He was busy
when I first called and I left the book with him.
That was at his brother’s house.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!” groaned Ruth. “Why didn’t you
write us about it?”
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t think of it. I give you my word I did
not believe that the bonds were worth anything;
and I was confident the money was phony.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear!” said Agnes. “And it’s all safe?
Mr. Howbridge has all that great lot of money?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I saw him Saturday before I came down
to Milton. He pretty nearly took me off my feet
when he said that it was all good stuff, with lots
of dividend money coming to the owner of the
bonds, too. And he wanted to know all the particulars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
of your finding the album. Bless you! he
doesn’t know what to think about it. He is only
sure that your Uncle Peter never owned the bonds
or the cash.”
</p>
<p>
“He didn’t,” sighed Agnes, “more’s the pity.
Oh, no, Ruthie. I am not sorry Mrs. Eland and
Miss Pepperill are going to be rich. But we could
have made good use of some of that money.”
</p>
<p>
“Buying an automobile, for instance?” suggested
Neale, chuckling.
</p>
<p>
“Be careful, young man,” Agnes warned him.
“If you carry a joke too far, you shall never be
allowed to run the Corner House automobile when
we <em>do</em> get it.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be good,” said Neale, promptly. “For I
have a sneaking sort of idea that maybe you <em>will</em>
have one, Aggie, before long.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Neale!”
</p>
<p>
“Fact. Somebody’s going to get a bunch of
money for finding that album. And <em>you</em> are the
one who really made the find, Aggie Kenway.”
</p>
<p>
“Now I know I shall faint!” gasped the next to
the oldest Corner House girl.
</p>
<p>
“We wouldn’t want money for giving Mrs.
Eland what belongs to her,” Ruth said quietly.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe not,” said Neale, grimly. “But I
guess Mr. Howbridge knows his business. He is
your guardian. He will apply to the court for the
proper reward for you, if it isn’t forthcoming from
the beneficiaries themselves.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness, Neale O’Neil! How you talk,” said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
Agnes, in wonder. “You talk just like a lawyer
yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe I will be one some day,” said the boy,
diffidently. “But Mr. Howbridge talked a lot to
me about the matter on Saturday. He said of
course the real owners of the money and bonds
must be hunted up. Perhaps he has some shrewd
suspicion as to who they may be.
</p>
<p>
“But you girls have got rights in any treasure
trove found in the old Corner House—”
</p>
<p>
“Gracious mercy me! I hope I shall find a lot
more money and bonds,” declared Agnes. “I’m
going right up to the attic to-morrow and hunt
some more.”
</p>
<p>
But of course she did not. There were too many
things happening on the morrow. Mr. Howbridge
came from Tiverton and the girls found him at the
Corner House when they came home from school.
</p>
<p>
He brought with him a statement showing how
much money there was in that treasure trove found
in the garret, and the value of the railroad bonds
and the dividends due on them.
</p>
<p>
He was quite ready to believe Ruth’s discovery
regarding the true ownership of the treasure, too.
</p>
<p>
“I have heard Peter Stower often say that he
wondered what Lemuel Aden did with his money.
He stuck to it that Lem was a wealthy man, but
the very worst kind of a miser.
</p>
<p>
“And that he should bring his wealth here and
hide it in the old Corner House is not at all surprising.
As a boy he played about here with your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
Uncle Peter. He knew the old garret as well as
you children do, I warrant.”
</p>
<p>
Later Mr. Howbridge went with Ruth to call on
the matron of the Women’s and Children’s Hospital.
Mrs. Eland produced the diaries and Mr.
Howbridge read the notes referring to the old
miser’s “Beautiful Book.”
</p>
<p>
It was decided by the Courts, at a later time,
that the money and bonds all belonged to the two
sisters, sole remaining heirs of Lemuel Aden. Mr.
Howbridge acted for both parties in the transaction
and nothing was said about any reward due
the Corner House girls for making the odd find in
the garret.
</p>
<p>
That is, there was little said about any reward
just then. But Agnes went about with such a smiling
face that everybody who knew her stopped to
ask what it meant.
</p>
<p>
“Why, don’t you know?” she said. “Just as
soon as we can have it built, there will be a garage
in our back yard. And Neale O’Neil is studying
at the Main Street Garage every day after school,
so he can run a car and take out a license like Joe
Eldred. And—”
</p>
<p>
“But you haven’t a car, Aggie Kenway!” cried
Eva Larry, who was one of the most curious.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no; not yet,” drawled Agnes, with fine nonchalance.
“But we’re having one built for us.
Mr. Howbridge himself ordered it for us. And
it’s going to be big enough to take out the whole
Corner House family.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
</p>
<p>
It was not that the other Corner House girls had
no interest in this forthcoming pleasure car; but
there were so many other things, to take up their
attention.
</p>
<p>
Ruth was interested in getting Barnabetta and
her father settled in two very nice rooms on
Meadow Street for the winter. There they would
remain until the circus season opened in the spring.
</p>
<p>
Barnabetta had secured a position for a few
months that would support her and the clown; and
Neale had written to his Uncle Bill Sorber and obtained
a contract for the Scruggs’ for the next season.
</p>
<p>
Miss Pepperill was back from the State Hospital
and her sister and she were all ready to go
across the Continent to remain a year at least.
Milton people who knew her work, were sorry to
see Mrs. Eland go. Her friends, however, were
glad that never again would the little gray lady
and her red-haired sister have to worry about ways
and means.
</p>
<p>
As for the little girls, their interests were as
varied as usual. But principally they were rejoicing
that Sammy Pinkney was well on the road to
health, Dr. Forsyth having brought him safely
through the scarlet fever.
</p>
<p>
“And for a boy that’s had quarantine and epidermis,
too, all at the same time, it’s quite wonderful,”
Dot said. “And—and there’s a chance
for him yet to grow up and be a pirate!”

school and make many friends. One of these invites the girls to
spend a few weeks at a bungalow owned by her parents, and the
adventures they meet with make very interesting reading. Clean,
wholesome stories of humor and adventure, sure to appeal to all
young girls.

Elizabeth Ann is a little girl whom we first meet on a big train,
traveling all alone. Her father and mother have sailed for
Japan, and she is sent back East to visit at first one relative’s
home, and then another. Of course, she meets many new friends,
some of whom she is quite happy with, while others—but you must
read the stories for yourself. Every other girl who reads the
first of these charming books will want all the rest; for
Elizabeth Ann is certainly worth the cultivating.

“The trouble with Linda Lane,” said Mrs. Quincy, “was that she
’couldn’t get along with folks.’” As everyone knows, a girl needs
friends to love her and believe in her. It isn’t to be
wondered at that Linda wasn’t happy. Then little Miss Gilly came
to the rooms of the Society, the only home Linda knew, and took
the girl home with her. A new life begins for Linda, and she
finds, to her surprise and delight, how to get along with people,
how to make friends, and slowly and surely how to be happy.
</p>
<p>
Linda admires independence above all other traits of character.
She has plenty of that quality herself and she is the kind of
girl who not only cheerfully fights her own battles, but those of
the weaker who cannot defend themselves. She is “bossy,” lovable,
impatient and loyal, a born manager, whose plans invariably work
out to satisfactory conclusions, and Linda has a definite plan
which gradually unfolds in these books written about her—the sort
of plan only a girl without a home and parents of her own could
think of and carry to completion. Linda Lane knows what she wants
and she is willing to work and trust to her own efforts to make
her wishes come true.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
